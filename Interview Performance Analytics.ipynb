largest countries so tell me something about the city and also its social fabric can you tell us whether some relationships and adverse weather phenomena when was this Island territory needed to Sri Lanka yes coming good morning good morning please give a brief introduction about yourself I am from Srikakulam district of Andhra Pradesh I am from village background and my parents are into agriculture I have done my graduation from NIT Trichy in electronics and communication engineering I graduated in 2019 after that I worked as a chip design engineer in Qualcomm for more than 2 years after that I have written and started preparing for civil services this is my second attempt and first interviews tell me why do you want to join the civil services working the Qualcomm getting a very handsome salary what do you want to compromise on less salary in passionate about civil services because civil services as a career will give me diverse opportunities and growth in this sector and I am also very much satisfied if I can get second get to work close to the people if you can problems I will be more satisfied explain to us why I have chosen is your first preference why not any other service as a career gives me diverse opportunities at the start of the career I will get to work close to the people at the Grass root level and as I go up the ladder I will get the I will get to use this experience and in policy making this will help me do you think that is only IAS who can solve all problems of the country is one of the civil services who play active part in the administration and policy making other than this all the other services also have their own utility and all the services together will contribute to the social economic growth of the countries electronics and all so why it is semiconductor issue of discussion in the country semiconductors what is the role in particular every sector that we operate today rate from agriculture towards defence industry we have a lot of dependence on semiconductors in the demand is going to increase in the future tense that is why government also prioritise this sector and came up with the national semiconductor mission so as to establish N2 and system in the country right from designing to fabrication we have to establish the whole supply chain in the market so that are import dependency will reduce and it will add to our security as well what are the issues in semiconductor in the country in the semiconductor change today we are very good in the design front we have very good human resources but we do not have a fabrication ecosystem in the country because fabrication requires a lot of capital establishing a single friend request billions of dollars in investment under the same time we are also depending on imports for lot of raw materials right from Silicon Wafers we are depending China forever imports and also this is highly Technology intensive and it requires continuous upgradation particularly the fabrication plants so these challenges are coming in the way of establishing a robust system in the country but we are releasing the importance and we are moving forward to partner with the private sector to establish the system in the country is grappling with regard to invest to find out the solution rapidly progressing towards the CV ecosystem because of the commitments we have towards meeting of global targets but Rapid adaptation and challenges today particularly the battery systems are not very efficient and we cannot go long distances using the present battery setup and also we have certain bottlenecks in the infrastructure as well we do not have a robust charging infrastructure across the country so that it will limit the adoption and also the receipt and safety concerns as well associated with these batteries particularly there are incidents where the second batteries are exploded and it is causing safety shoes to the public as well I think these challenges are to be addressed so that we can rapidly transition towards the electric vehicles which can decarbonize the transport sector final question from my side what are the key features of Indian space policy 2023 the major objective is to encourage more private players in the space ecosystem currently the space research and all is concentrated by ISRO and we want to establish the private ecosystem so that today we capture around 2% of the global market and our target is to increase to 40 billion dollars by 20 within the next five years establishing robust private sector one of the priorities and also ISRO wants to spin of some of its Technologies like the launch vehicle systems and all to private sector so that it can focus on core machines like Mangalyaan mission solar missions and all so that is one key objective and also logic want to attract the innovation and investments so that address security challenges particularly with involvement of private sector but I think we as a as a country towards we have to progress in this sector and we have to frame a robust regulatory Framework for the private sector 108 in the government missions creating this robot system we have large number of persons from Eastern India that is from Andhra Pradesh in Tamil Nadu in South Asian countries which country has the largest concentration of Indian among asean members I do not have the numbers but I think Singapore has large population of Indian desperate particularly from the southern states and other than Singapore in Malaysia we have very good diaspora and recently in Cambodia and Thailand also called as far as increasing why this is why do we have largest countries history with India from the historical point of view we have our cultural ties particularly Buddhism in the Asia which is one factor and also we have trade ties with the action as well particularly in the medial and the during the Chola times so we are strongly building upon this relations and since it is proximity to our Southern states in the Eastern states of most of the people are migraine to action in such a better opportunities I could think of these reasons you think this look East policy which adopted 91 and actress policies in 2014 is a bringing some extra advantage to Indian economy and society as a government we have realised the importance of Asian particularly for our people to people ties as well as growth of trade so we have we have devised this look East policy and practice policy to leverage upon the relations and promote robust economic growth between these two countries because it is a very good market opportunity for India as well so we have to establish strong relations with these countries what is approximate share of foreign trade export and import 78% in which country is the biggest trading partner of India Singapore in my understanding because we get a lot of f Singapore Aircel very small population populated country consume a huge amount of goods from us what is by the way population of Singapore and the total area is it as big as Madras City or Hyderabad city or smaller recently we have some controversy in our relationship with Myanmar what exactly is the ratio democratic government is stopped by the Janata and currently military establishment is ruling in Myanmar and largely military is facing a lot of problems with the local Revolutionary groups and that is leading to mass Exodus of people from Myanmar particularly since we share a large border with Myanmar we have a problem of illegal migration and also giving our security concerns we have decided to end the freezing moment with myan particularly we wanted to friends our borders to stop this illegal migration and associated challenges like drug trafficking etc so these things will come into a relation will disturb the relation between the countries and I think we have to engaged truly with the establishment in Myanmar in addressing these issues so what is the opinion of the Government of the military government are there policy or they are upset did not have specific answer but I think it will going to disturb people to people ties between these two countries because we do not we do have a lot of ethnicity relations between the people and as a whole this has to be sorted out by sitting together and discussion and coming to amicable solution do you think that our relationship between our neighbourhood countries because everybody is the first in the recent times we have certain challenges that are faced by the certain challenges with our neighbouring countries particularly the present government in Maldives is taking certain measures which are not very confused towards growing of relations between the countries it is going more towards China which is a challenging concern for us and also in Sri Lanka China is engaging actively with this country it is investing a lot in the infrastructure and they are increasing their footprint in the Indian Ocean region that is one concern for us in the smart persons like you must go into Foreign Service so as to improve our bargaining position in this country have robust human power resources in our ministry of external affairs and their fault in is not completely dominating in our country but they have settled in our country in Maldives in Sri Lanka in Myanmar in Nepal I think it is because of the advantages that China has particularly in the financial and military front they are very head of India in terms of GDP their financially very strong and through belt and Road initiative they are investing billions of dollars in infrastructure in these countries so through economic leverage they are trying to win the trust of these countries and also the building something about the city and also its social fabric is the northernmost district of Andhra Pradesh it is the least urbanised district in Andhra Pradesh we have around 16% Urban population and most of the people live in rural areas and they depend on agriculture for their liveli Anda Machhali Srikakulam is one of the districts having very good positive sex ratio we have more than 1050 for every thousand mail as per 2011 census and also Srikakulam as a whole is highly Hospital district people are very hard working and they are very hospitable their very hard working and rich cultural heritage as well we have very good important Hindu and Buddhist sites are there in Srikakulam so it has also biodiversity as well as an excellent district in Andhra what do you understand by farmers distress as multiple dimensions for example the recent changes in the climate change it is going to affect their productivity so declining Hills is one of the challenges that farmers are facing due to temperature rises and also largely input costs are rising which is facing a tall and farmers production due to various of climate like due to droughts and due to floods 39 they are facing lot of challenges in post harvest operations since I come from my village I can see the challenges that the farmers face particularly once they harvester in produce due to lack of good storage facilities they have to do distress sale of the produce because of lack of these opportunities so input side processing and they do not get reminded to prices for their produce think these factors are adding to the distance of farmers so what is the way out what is the way out for protecting the vagaries of natural calamities Technology can be leveraged particularly we have very good weather forecasting system we have ISRO is there so through satellite monitoring and application of big data as well we can have the record of past events the flat cyclones etc so that we can predict the future after a set an extent so that measures can be taken so that losses can be minimised and also Technology can be leveraged to increase the input productivity as well particularly application of iot in agriculture has lot of benefits for the farmers from a reducing input cost through smart irrigation smart fertilizer application so Hills can also be improved so this can play a major role what are walking forests it is again very much in news do you think that it is suitable for climate like India or the kind of topography we have here in India growing height in forest in urban areas so as to increase the green colour only mean that growing green trees growing bigger long trees many other things since India is very very topography and climatic conditions I think we have to take regional approach in applying this miyawaki method to increase the green colour as well as other benefits so particularly in the plains and the coastal regions we can approach this method it also adds to the aesthetic statistics of urban areas as well and addresses the address the issues like temperature rise and what is it it is a compulsory afforestation management fund particularly where forests are divorced they have to pay at amount to this one so that deforestation can happen at an alternate place it as it is designed to reduce the effects of deforestation for infrastructure and development activities and balance the loss of forest cover by planting by deforestation why are sandal red sandal Woods are in use and why are under threat Amritsar red sandals are particular species which are grown specifically in the districts of Andhra Pradesh particularly in the seshachalam region they have high demand and market across the East Asian countries like Japan and China so because of this demand they are very much prone to smuggling particularly in these regions a lot of illegal felling of trees are happening so that is the last two biodiversity as well as it is running organised crime in these regions so government has identified the issues and taking certain measures to correct this issue by encouraging private plantations of these red sandals so that birthday on the natural forest will be decreased and it can also be remitted cultivate and an income as well Venkatesh entire south India is staring at a water crisis right now the Reservoir water level in all almost all reservoirs are below the sufficient level mark can you suggest a sum of I mean the improvement measures is triggered by various of climate particularly we have deficit rainfall particular in the last season that is contributing to this issue we have to we can take certain measures which can address this issue one thing is efficient water usage across the across the landscape particularly in urban areas we face is challenges in a intense particular in the cities like Bengaluru efficient water usage is one thing where we can promote secular use of water treated water can be utilised for purposes that are not for drinking so that what are you will be minimised industry also as a whole can apply such practices were treated water will be utilised for their for their needs instead of freshwater so that but then on the people will be reduced and then the long term we have to take sustainable water harvesting as well as a major we have to address the deforestation is used across the riverfront which particular in the base in India as a student of Geography can you tell us whether some relation exist between the events and the adverse weather phenomenon is a weather condition where question will get warmer when compared to the temperature in the Western Pacific ocean so it has a phenomena at least to increase the draught like conditions in Indian subcontinent it is to failure of monsoon so that we will face water challenge at a more intense level El Nino we have brought like conditions in India and with it will have it will lead to heavy rainfall in countries like South America it has very impacts across the world recently the ex Governor of RBI Raghuram Rajan has raised some of his concern about India being so in India's GDP or India's economic growth is being so high right what are exactly his concerns from your general kind of understanding can you tell India's too much focus on economic growth is it just a high or real case of scenario or is there any structural problems that need to be settled before we keep on talking about the high GDP numbers GDP numbers is one of the indicator economic growth we are going at 728 % rate and we are also the third largest fifth largest economy in the world for economic growth is not going to address all the problems because in India particularly we are facing situation like jobless growth where the economic growth is not providing equivalent number of jobs particularly populous country and our youth has to be provided with employment opportunities as well because in the latest employment report by elbow it said that 83% of our employed contribute to the unemployment numbers in the country for this has to be addressed in the growth of girls is also should be equitable particularly we have a lot of income inequalities in the country as per the latest reports only top 1% occupied 26% of external affairs minister has been in India right can you tell us the rule that India can play in stopping or at least making this war like situation slightly better kind of situation given the positive relations India has with western countries as well as Russia India can be a player in bringing these countries towards stable and ensuring that dialogue and diplomacy can be the way forward in addressing this crisis so India can be a player but I think it is largely the willingness of these countries to corporate which will decide the future course of action that you love playing cricket you love watching cricket also can you tell us a phenomena in terms of Cricket Fever shape of cricket we worship in last 10 years that you have observed any kind of significant observation is changing in last 10 years as far as cricket discussion there is a lot of Grace and popularity for short term formats in cricket particularly the league T20 league and private T20 league there is a some trend observed particularly in the last 334 years I would say particular there is also renewed craze for test cricket as a whole because ICC has introduced world test Championship in order to promote the popularity of test cricket and it is also gaining popularity in these days any kind of gender wise inclusivity in terms of worship BCCI has done a lot of initiatives to promote women cricket as well they have introduced pay parity in cricket male and women players will get equal remuneration of match fees and also due to the introduction of women Premier League as well as a lot of your ship is for women's cricket as well and people are supporting the island of again again attention in the recent times so what is the issue involved in the DJ Patiala between India and Sri Lanka earlier Indian fisherman used to fish on this Island and as part of agreements between India and Sri Lanka this has gone to Sri Lanka so it is one point of contention between local fisherman this particularly so we were denied in fishing rights and other rights in this region was this Island territory seeded to Sri Lanka do not remember in the 70s 1974 as a consequence of this session of this territory to Sri Lanka what are the economic disadvantages on India's part local fisherman lost the rights of fishing in this particular Island so that is going to affect the local communities and our income as well and now since it is part of Sri Lanka is there is also going to be changes in the explosive economic zone in this particular region Sri Lanka will have greater waters particularly in this short space between India and Sri Lanka that is going to alter this economic zone and we are lose certain rights of the sea as well ok so Venkatesh can you also tell us what are the constitutional provisions with regards to session of any territory by India true or foreign Nation articles 124 there are certain agreements about incorporation of Territory or suggestion of territory do not also there provisions related to incorporation but I'm not sure about ok no problems are approaching the threat of forest fires will also grow up so can you tell us what are the reasons for the forest fires in India understand couple of reasons for this forest thing it is natural as well as artificial maids in the natural regions we have increasing temperatures particularly as part of this climate change so that is leading to loss of moisture across in these forests and these forests are prone to this forest fires on mono cultivation practices also one of the factors particularly in Uttarakhand and spine plantations which we are rising we are more susceptible to forest fires and the certain disasters intentional and unintentional happening and these are contribution of which parts of the country particularly which states are more vulnerable to the events of forest fires it is Northern belt in the Himalayan region like Himachal Pradesh in Uttarakhand part of the country specifically Andhra Pradesh do not have a date of regions it is prone to forest fires what steps taken to control these events by the state machinery or the union government machinery multiple initiative certificate uses of Technology particularly Drone surveillance can be applied to understand the extent of this forest fires and necessary interventions can be made encouraging encouraging drivers plantations instead of Mono cropping can be one solution to address these issues and also Forest Department actively involved with the local communities to delineate the reasons which are susceptible to forest fires and take measures like cleaning of Under growth which are particularly helpful in this forest fires and boundary Jones can be created earthquakes tell me how magnitude of earthquake is different from intensity of the earthquake magnitude of the earthquake is measured by Richard scale it talks about the amplitude of the seismic wave particularly that is measured on the scale there is intensity of earthquake is measured based on the destructive potential of the earthquake the based on the amount of damage it causes to property and everything what is the scale used Mercedes skill and have you heard about this focus of the earthquake concept is the point inside the earth crust where the earthquakes that originated and from this focus is more towards the surface it is the epicenter point and once it comes to the surface the surface waves are responsible for most of the destruction thank you thank you your interview is on 5th itself which attempt is this is my second attempt and first interview how was your experience today with us it was good sir I am able to give decent answers to most of the questions but in the initial stage I just came in India at the very outset the wonderful candidate to talk to and you got a singers on variety of issues and your opinion your presentation everything was excellent which is negative in your personality was while talking of the time you kept on tapping your legs like tapping we could see from here trampling tapping whatever it is but make sure that your legs or hands are not moved that is very important because whatever good work you do whatever good engagement we have in the by way of conversation that gets distracted when you look at you as a person just that much nothing I don't know it is your habit or out of nervousness of the time you kept on initial 10 15 minutes what was the reason and all that but make sure that doesn't happen that doesn't happen you are basically engineer electronics and communication some questions related to growth of electronic industry in our country because you are coming from Andhra Pradesh all the more important the service sector what the government of India has been doing to ensure the growth of electronic centre in our country in the Solar Centre industry in our country and what are incentives have been given by the spoke about the dalit all that clusters and all should contain that will be one communication is another area apart from your problems in the telecom sector and all that it should be fully aware you must be knowing also the Telecom actors of 2023 go through that what is the controversy involved why some people feel that this is curtailing the freedom of liberty and expression and so look at that and there is an IT acts of 2023 which has also been amended is it some parties are making acquisitions against the government why it has been done in East and all that you just read what it should be aware of it and you should be able to explain it in the most balanced panel because this is the personality test not the knowledge you don't know certain things doesn't matter but you should not speaking anything without knowing the personal integrity is very important personal honesty is very important sure that is never ever compromised while talking about that is one thing your student of Geography we tried to ask you questions on Geography about the monsoon forecast made by the IMD for the year 2024 about the impact of early no we discussed and all that what is the impact of early no what is the impact of Lana and all that what are those concepts and from where these concepts have come up why we are using WhatsApp general questions general basic questions of Geography should be able to explain could be used to happen that whatever questions have asked today you won't be getting any of these questions when you go for the interview but that doesn't matter what matters is your sincerity your effort your presentation ideas very effectively very confidently it is really very good and you are opinion was balanced on the issues which we discussed with you we had a very logical and clear exposition also that is very very important and your interest and knowledge in current affairs was also after that nothing to worry about good personality wonderful person you will be getting good marks in the interview it all depends on how I have done your means but let me assure you that interview is not going to let you know and very balanced reviews after being frozen cons of
