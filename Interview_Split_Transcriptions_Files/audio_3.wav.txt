how do individual differences in personality impact decision making to be continued to hold secularism word in the Preamble when we say he has a vision of 6/6 yes or someone has a vision of 6 by 12 what is that implies what you understand by emotional intelligence what is the difference between psychologist and psychiatrist good afternoon good afternoon thank you sir please introduce yourself my name is Deepak Yadav I was born in Haryana Mahendergarh after that my schooling was in Army Public School and graduation from Rajasthan University in Ba after 12th class I pursued for NDA examination and secured all India rank 96% due to medical reasons that is retinal degeneration I was unable to join Sir after graduation I tried for CDS but finding that I am still medical unfit I started for civil services examination this is my second interview and this is my second attempt and first interview my hobbies are home workout and meditation answer graduation with history and economics did some research and read NCERT class 11th and find the subject very interesting and I had the confidence that I can do this exam with optional psychology so I opted for this subject how to individual differences in personality impact decision making yes sir individual differences are due to both genetic factors as well as our environment sir they impact decision making for example sir if an individual parents are professors in any university then the individual is likely to pursue higher studies and may make more focus on studies where is if individuals parents are from sports background then he is likely to go for sports as a career service individual differences impact our decision making sir both in terms of relationships as well as professional life we understand that our human brain has two sides one is IQ and other is equal isn't it administrator or a Civil Servant what is more importantly speaking both are very important but depending upon the situation one can be more important than the other sir for example in policy making taking policy decisions implementation of policy giving feedback regarding policy in such areas are IQ is more important whereas interacting with weaker sections in controlling volatile situations like you are more important roles are mental disorder is is becoming an issue in our country how effective therapeutic approaches are in treating their in treating the medical disorder yes sir various schools of psychology have their own therapies but the psychologist make individual assessment sir based on various inventories and assessment tools and depending upon the factors of mental disorder therapist use various ideas of different therapies this is known as electric approach so that electric approach is very effective in treating various mental disorders recently the supreme court judgement upheld the legal validity of linking Aadhaar with PAN card but at the same time provided some relief also examples where Aadhar card is not linking of Aadhar card is not required and two examples where it is sir I have to read about the topics about thank you student of economics which you studied aggression level BSF how do you define elasticity of demand and its importance in explaining religious tourism sir may I make a gas in elasticity of demand for elasticity of demand refers to the change in demand percentage change in demand due to percentage change in Income Certificate with respect to price variation as well as applied to explain religious tourism for example if the infrastructure associated with places of religious tourism is improved like Kashi Vishwanath corridor it is likely that the demand for religious tourism will increase or expecting the digestion of psychology will apply some psychological what happens to bargaining attitude of a consumer if the consumer becomes emotional uncertain issue rather than remaining rational psl it is contrast the two different bargaining attitude of a rational consumer and emotionally emotional consumer starting with rational consumer rational consumer base is his decisions on factors like the utility of good is purchasing power the characteristics of the quality of good sir where is the emotional consumer impulsive behaviour sir for example if there is a sale cleaning that there is 50% of then the emotional consumer will instantly place the order rather than verifying the actual price of the goods are demand for religious tourism services is emotional demand or rational demand sir it depends on individual consumer sir both places plays the role Sir but at times like recently the Ram Mandir was inaugurated so in this period sir emotional demand may play greater role that is devotees may feel that they should be the first one to get the and which consumer is able to optimise his purchases a personal consumer who is rational in his bargaining or a consumer who is emotion is bargaining set the rational consumer because he effectively uses his economic resources are losses by paying more price for the same product unnecessary goods are like if there is a sale on clothing then even if the individual have the clothes in a purchase some cloth by promoting religious tourism do you think this is the long term sustainable model of development sir it is a long term sustainable model Sir As we are religious society since ancient and it is expected that our religious values will continue to grocer at the same time sir the factor that we are promoting religious tourism for all major religions sir for Hinduism like Kashi Vishwanath corridor the Ram temple for Buddhism Buddhist circuit for sick the Kapoor the Kartarpur Sahib corridor sir for Muslims we promote Hajj and tourism in Ajmer Sharif Dargah sir so because we are taking all religious religions together sir I think this model is sustainable in long answer will it be helpful in promoting scientific implement and Research Development in the country directly religious tourism is not related to scientific temper and Research and Development but if We combine critical thinking on religious aspects on religious teachings along with teaching rationality acceptance tolerance mutual respect such then I think sir it can positively impact but the direct impact is may not be very effective should be that is my last question should be continued to hold secularism word in the Preamble or should be definitely sir what definitely service should continue with the word secularism in our constitution sir because constitution the basic feature of Constitution is secularism as a stated by Supreme Court in various judgements like Keshav Nand Bharti Case the SR bommai case therefore it is a positive things are Deepak so you had some you know I related medical complications that did not let you join National Defence Services as your service to preference right so can you please tell me are you now physically and health wise fit enough to join the services in case you are inducted The Lasik operation for retina known as green Lasik sir it is a recent technology and there is not a direct mention about its permittivity in police services but considering that the medical standards in police services are relaxed in comparison to armature like in army in NDA we can join if we have a number of -2.5 but in police services the number is allowed up to 9 or 67 therefore I think indirect speech I am asking when we say he has a vision of 6/6 or someone has a vision of 6 by 12 what is that imply what does that mean 6 / 6 / 12 pair of spectacles has a plus power what does that mean what kind of IELTS disease I am suffering from positive number and for negative number it is myopia how this you know power is calculated what is the mathematical formula for calculation of power may I recollect sir it is minus b upon user minus b upon by f 1 by focal length ok tell me one bill has been introduced in Lok Sabha the bill has been passed and now it has been sent for discussion in Rajya Sabha Meanwhile the Lok Sabha has been dissolved what will be the fate of the bill will left another condition the bill has been introduced in Rajya Sabha before the discussion could take place but yes the bill is lying in the Lok Sabha the Lok Sabha has been resolved what will be the fate my next question to you the recently I mean in 2018 why reason because it's a big development this Ayushman Bharat campaign was is a big flagship project of Government of India has basically two components one is Wellness centres and others pmjay Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana can you please briefly tell me how the beneficiaries of pmjdy are identified what is the criteria sir I am not aware of specific criteria for ok you must be available recently the farmers were again you know at congregating at Delhi to protest for you know getting the legal assurance for MSP right right CSE I mean the commission of agriculture cost and price when it recommends MSP it takes many factors into company in that context three terms are often discussed one is a to another one is A2 + FL and the third one is C2 can you please tell me what is the difference between A2 and C2 is the direct all cost incurred by the farmer in cash or kind Sir for example the cost on inputs like seeds for fertilizers are C2 has A2 + FL that is family labour answer the cost that farmer in comes on self consumed capital sir like the land opportunity cost on land for sir capital machinery like tractor you every year the Government of India declared for certain crops MSP minimum support price for sugarcane frp is declared fair and remunerative prices technical difference is the only difference sir the difference is in MSP the government procure the output of farmer but in frp the private players that is super Industries procure the output of farmers Deepak what do you understand by emotional intelligence when emotional intelligence is the capacity of individual to assess his own emotions assess the emotions for the understand the emotions of other and use this knowledge to regulate his own emotions his ideas and his behaviour man how it is different from intelligence intelligence is basically limited to the academic year it is also known as analytical intelligence name intelligence is basically my more rational it does not involve the individual factors the subjective experience of individual and the feeling side of human personality emotional intelligence or intelligence earlier that is before 1950 IQ was the centre of focus but as we progressed realise that mental health is also important you need to be intelligent or emotionally intelligent when we should have both the traits in our personality mam as the earlier mentioned intelligence helps us that is IQ helps us to take objective decisions rational decisions to understand the policy and effective implementation decisions are also taken by an emotionally intelligent people also intelligent emotional intelligence in rational decisions has more subjectivity element when but rational decision if these are based on IQ then it has more objectives more in managing emotional intelligence helps us more in stress management is stress negative all the time the concept of stress was first given by two types of the first is you stress it is a positive stress man like if exams are approaching and the stress motivates the student to study more than it is you stress man it creates positive impact on your list stress is my negative impact if like exams are approaching and the student has distress then he may avoid studies mam what you understand by masculinity it is a term that is used to describe male characteristics and like high physically strength high testosterone physical characters like man bodybuilder extra emotional aspects like sensitivity to emotions not crime alert female characteristics name which is good for the society both are good but researchers believe that androgenic which is a personality or gender personality which has characteristics of both masculinity and femininity is better than a child of 12 years old died out of trivial violence in the school as he was bumped by a senior bumped into a senior fellow of his school for that the 12 year old child was beaten and it was so much hurt that some injury led to his death what kind of psychological theories you would apply to control such kind of behaviour in the school name the first is individual personality as some individuals especially in adolescent age have a positional personality disorder basically oppose every norm of society mam So such students may oppose the norms that we should apply this theory maybe it will work out ok mam we can use Ocean theory that is big five theory of personality it has five tradesman the first is openness openness mam is the willingness of individual to accept the arguments of other recently women reservation bill was passed you would consider it as a woman that development of women development I may consider it as a woman development specifically in the Parliament but the male members leading business what is the difference between psychologist and psychiatrist psychologist has a degree in psychology where is psychiatrist as a degree in Medical Sciences second defence research psychologist can only do counselling but cannot recommend drug treatment for give electroconvulsive therapy circuit that is soft treatment but psychiatrist can do this both sir why do people commit suicide sir every suicide is a misfortune and shows low poles on parts of society sir suicide suicide is a very extreme decision and there is no one factor that compels and individual to committed different factors can be social stigma like taking hypothetical case if someone has third gender from minority Gender and if he is identity is disclosed in school and if he is bullied for the sexual identity then due to socialistic of the individual extreme step another is sir family pressure of societal pressure that you are a student of psychology can you tell us some of the indicators which one should look after may be for the family members or the friends around which indicates towards mental distress and this person may commit suicide in future yes sir primary factor that one should look for his social withdrawal sir that is individually stops interacting with loved ones second year changes in behaviour patterns like not sleeping at night increase drug consumption that is alcohol or Other Drugs another is sir impulsive behaviour like aggression and other is emotional breakdown like sir crying on small things and another is the loss of appetite that is not taking interest in can you tell us what do you understand by ecological value of mountains ecological value of mountains are the first is their value in creating rainfall sir that is on windward side they give main higher rainfall importance the second is security important answer for example Himalayas protect us from invasion from other countries talking about the development in the mountainous regions it is a widely accepted fact that the pace at which we are going ahead with the development agenda it is causing heavy loss to the ecological system of the mountains so if you are given this opportunity to reconsider the Char Dham Pariyojna that is going in the state of Uttarakhand how will you set the first is revisiting the economic impact assessment of the project sir and depending on this we can figure out various concerns and address those concerns that is a second year trying to balance between economy and Ecology sir that is we should maximize the development while also focusing on minimising their negative impact on Environment sir this can be done by doing a forest station to you what impact can you see if more number of women join the armed forces the first is change in mindset forces but in society also and that is we perceive female gender as a weaker gender but if women join then we will the perception will change that women are also stronger gender second is a more role models for girls in our society to become courageous and join not just armed forces but following their dreams in general sir thank you tell me talking about the panchayats despite legislative executive Judiciary interventions holding this extra constitution has not been able to be disappointed sir the primary reason is the social social banking that the panchayat enjoy sir prevalent in villages and generally sir one village has one major causes represent those cars so people of those cars to protect their own interest give support to ka Panchayat the second year due to the social support the politicians also do not act against especially for the wrongs committed by Gram Panchayat and search the third reason is result of second that is due to the social support and the political support the
