what is the five eyes allies which countries are there in airlines how does Surge in nuclear families has impacted the economy of India you see India is one of the largest producer of milk yet now India is importing milk why is this happening so why green revolution started in Punjab so what is your stand on the cracker when good afternoon please give a brief introduction about yourself my name is I belong to Kapurthala Punjab I have done my schooling till 12th standard from kabutar itself post my schooling I went on to graduate from Delhi Technological University in mechanical engineering the during my college I got a chance to represent my college in USA suppose my college I work for one year as an analyst and Iqbal after that I started preparing for civil services examinations and since last year I have been working with Intelligence Bureau what is your role in the I am currently posted in Maharashtra area involved generating actionable intelligence inputs on certain organisation of interest regarding law and order regarding social issues which can lead to security situation and in the meanwhile like to have financial independence and to explore the world of Intelligence I join Intelligence Bureau and I simultaneously kept preparing for civil services examination in diplomatic relationship between India and Canada according to you what could have been the reasons for such a state of affairs I believe that India Canada relations the Canada prime minister statement in part in its Parliament the was more of because of the domestic politics involved the Canadian Prime Minister did not give any proof for any allegation and just to appease the local population he made certain statements so that's why India's strongly opposed such comments what is 5 which countries are there in real life intelligence was founded by western countries I am not aware of the years but this involves countries like us ke Australia New Zealand and Canada voice for a separate Khalistan has been reappearing again not in India but in the forest why I believe their certain factors for it the firstly there are certain diaspora currently which is involved is slowly demanding this on the base of certain literature on certain radicalization it has been done the secondly is the role of other Enemies of the Indian states such as Pakistan ISI role is being set to fuel at the thirdly there were some population that refuse in 1987 so that is some base in UK and Canada that is repeatedly raising such demand while in India no such demand is being this you must have been watching the performance of the state government in how do you react to this previous culture free bus ride free electricity and all how do you react to that and how does it impact the state revenue while I believe that the government should undertake certain schemes for Welfare of sections such as free bus ride for women because that is equally important for them to come and join the labour force and to be independent on the similar lines are I believe that their needs to be some financial prudence involved in such schemes for example free electricity to farmers that started in 1997 in Punjab the sum involved was only 697 crore but now that has been that has reason to 20000 crores so that prudence need to be taken because Punjab is reeling under heavy that because the dead to state GDP ratio is 50% or not maintained what could be a specific suggestion to garment the firstly I believe that raising the revenue is one of the key areas and to curtail the revenue deficit by raising debt in revenue from excise excise and taxation and ramping up GST state collection that is one of the things secondly against a consolidation of revenue expenditure and thirdly I believe a capex needs to be enhanced so that infrastructure development is this question from my side Punjab had witnessed green revolution why the country is not having another green revolution of because country we face certain Although we face many positive aspects will also be ascertained challenges with respect to Green Revolution so now we are moving forward with evergreen Revolution where for example recently climate resilient wheat crops seeds were given to farmers and 60% of the wheat crop that was on last year was climate moving towards evergreen revolutions are now your option is anthropology right tell me that how the changing demography of India largely if we see in urban areas how this search in nuclear families has impacted the economy of India has been arise in nuclear families in urban areas primarily because of the high cost of living first of all so I believe that there is an aspects to it one positive aspect that it has led to the people coming out from rural area settling in urban areas nuclear families that they are contributing to the economy of the country like urban areas provide more opportunities to one is that respect positive for the economy but while there is also a downside to it like there has been neglect of the elder so which has led to heavy expenditure on their health so that again decreases the savings so that has a negative impact on the economy man so this nuclear family is more viable for growing economy or the joint family system is more viable specifically in the context of India I believe that this depends on the family to family while certain joint families like several business groups have thrive personally as well as contributed a lot to India being in joint family while sometimes nuclear family is also important to come out like farming communities which have very less land so they need to come out to urban areas live in a certain setup so that they can contribute to the economy induced displacement how it has impacted the indigenous communities and if it has adversely affected them so shall we laughing or shall we stop any kind of developmental projects certainly mam development displacement is there especially that has led to displacement of indigenous tribes for example certain dams or certain mining activities that have been done but I believe that development needs is the need of the hour and their needs to be a development that is considered of the needs of the indigenous as well we need to strike a balance like there has been a report by a committee RK Roy Burman committee so he advised that in every project like tribal should be involved to have a package and there was also policy National rehabilitation policy in 2007 which stated that tribals should be when this place they should be set up in the area which is very similar to the ones they were living in difficult mam I believe similar Habitat can found because India is with proper care they are and proper in economic compensation is given to them and all the considerations are taken it is possible mam So we need to strike a balance ok what is your take on one Nation one election who is heading the committee the recent form of committee headed by former President Shri Ram Nath kovind ji and the committee is yet to a certain give a report on it I believe that there are both positive as well as negative aspects to it while one Nation one election of simultaneous selection as it is called Delhi to reduce expenditure reduce security movement as well as less politically charged environment throughout the grassroot level of participation if I take an example of certain States also elections with the Lok Sabha like 425 States go to elections with Lok Sabha so there has been no trend that has been observed in these states like people have voted separately for like different parties in both these elections so I believe that not their needs to be studies regarding it so that before we come to any conclusion mam my last question to you Gaurav why there is so much chance for Punjabi songs is it related with language or is it related with the rhythm I believe that there are certain factors to it first of all is mam that obviously the rhythm the music that is very upbeat so even if one does not understand the lyrics One tends to dance on IT second mam I believe is the popularity that is that has been given to it by the Western diaspora Punjabi diaspora as well as the Bollywood map so that has led to more popular thank you Gaurav ok but I have observed the strength that Punjabi songs would either talk about cars materialistic achievements or women and that two objective for them don't you think it will have a bad impact on our society yes mam indeed the songs objectified weapons cars and women like increase in Gangs and organised crime Nexus related to it ma'am so recently mam the Punjab Police in Punjab government has come for come up with strong regulations for it like there will be censorship if someone but also we need to see that there needs to be awareness among the society also like the singer sometimes they come out in the intervention say that if we sing some meaningful song that that does not get trending Hip Hop culture and this rising Punjabi song culture since it's your hobby I believe that there is a like mixing of both these cultures like the pop music is getting mixed in the Punjabi songs talk about dairy farming your father is into dairy farming you see India is one of the largest producers of milk yet now India is importing milk why is this happening certain reports that we were importing powdered Milk but the government has said that has negative all these comments and said that we are not importing milkman because we Although we have a very huge production and I don't think so we are reporting tell me biggest challenges that daily farming industry in India is facing we need to know the milk Revolution what are the challenges while we have solved the supply side problem like we have around 220 million tons of production area the largest milk producer and there are certain problems in the regional disparities as well as the retail retailing of that milk and to all the segments equally to all the sections of the population so that their challenges to eat my first of all because of the lack of infrastructure such as cold storage chilling infrastructure that is one of the challenge second is mam the regional disparity like some of the states are producing high by the other states have blooming production so that needs to be solved map the rising cost of fodder and etc rising diseases in cattle so these are the emerging challenges which need in Punjab also going towards it and you know traffic as per the report there are three primary reasons for it first is mam that when police raids gets any tip when they read the house the men run away while leaving the counter band behind so that's why women get book because women are there in the house second is mam the drug peddlers are also drug users so obviously the Die prematurely because of the effects of it so women because of economic compulsions get into this trade and third is the most glaring trend that has been observed that women are also being drug consumers so regularly consume the drugs to drug to have that money so they get intelligence what makes you angry I am not able to perform as per my Expectations I get angry with myself now you are from Kapurthala Kapurthala is known for its wonderful buildings can you tell me few those buildings so one was my school itself sir it was elec Palace it was the palace for the queen at that time so it was a formally princely state so one is that one is Jagjit club which is the local district what kind of architecture is it this architecture was constructed by the Jagjit Singh Maharaja Jagjit Singh in 1927 because he was fascinated by the architecture of Paris like different so he tried to replicate that that's also sometimes called Paris of Punjab right right Punjab is also known for Green Revolution right so why green revolution started in Punjab green revolution started in Punjab Haryana and western up because of certain factors one was the wheat crop was chosen firstly to have to increase the production of wheat crop in India is had conducive climate for the growth of wheat crop as it is good enough a cold in winter one of the reason for that second was the prosperity that was already existing the irrigation systems were already existing here because the blood circulate separate canals so that was one of the reason that government opted for the states initially and third person the land reforms had some success initially in These areas so I can recall right now the reason and what are the what are some of the adverse impacts of Green revolution specially on Punjab negative impacts of Green revolution first is the loading water table because of growing of certain water Gosling crops second is air pollution issue that is now one of that has recently been added to the social issues like the drug problem is also said to be because one of the causes green revolution because of the surplus income mechanization there was the youth was rendered jobless and free with money in hand so that led to that problem any connection between the low sex ratio of Punjab and green revolution certainly some linkage can be drawn to its because again the farming communities don't want to give dowry like and spend on girls wedding shoot that is one of the causes for loss mechanical engineer what is difference in the fundamental design as far as the earlier automobiles and these e vehicles is there any major shift in design of the two the major difference in the power train design of the vehicle in the earlier IC in general vehicle there is a engine and there is a transmission system and further the power is transmitted from the transmission system by axles or Universal joints to the wheels the while in EVS there is a electric motor that generates power so the engine is replaced by the motor and transmission system also needs to be changed as per the dimensions and specifications while the transmission system remains and I think you have participated in some US based design vehicles or is there any any shortcomings related to their being a green vehicle while and that they have very less emissions while but it was but it is also said that they are just replacing source of emissions from 1 point to another like the electricity itself comes from the thermal power plants as of now I believe that in the coming times as India and other world is moving towards renewable energy so this limitation will also be solved Sir right and the last question from my end is Gaurav you are also working in IB there are certain allegations that all these attacks which are happening in Kashmir sporadic attacks there is some failure of Intelligence so how are you convinced with this idea and what should be done if there is at all these kind of situations while the attacks in Kashmir who is the very severe challenge to the intelligence community and law and order situation because these are very attacks there was no organisation that was involved in these were the hybrid hybrid militants who come from the civilian population and then the merged with itself but I believe in the past few months we have been able to tack to an extent the casualties have been reduced so we ramped up our efforts to find generate actionable intelligence inputs to find such mention as a student of anthropology can you tell me what is mutation is there are two types of mutation one is point mutation and one is the chromosomal mutation of gene mutation refers to the change in the composition in the DNS like for example one amino acid when it changes it changes the HB a gene to HP gas of mutations certain limitations are mostly harmful to humans but certainly there are advantages while so they of natural selection for example there was one study that humans are developing distance to in humans in Africa developing resistance to the cobras the Venom of Cobra so that was because of mutation what are green crackers the green crackers are green because they tend to cause less emissions less pollution and the material raw material they use is said to be less harmful to the environment so there has been an ongoing debate as far as the pollution from the cracker bursting is concerned and the vehicular pollution is concerned so what is your stand on the cracker Ban that is often imposed across the country and across specific areas Supreme Court even the state government I believe that is a step in the right direction for the health of human like for some movement of enjoyment because so much emissions so we can avoid that ok so being a mechanical engineering graduate can you tell me how many laws of thermodynamics are there with three laws of thermodynamics while there is also zeroth law of thermodynamics can you tell me what is the zeroth law of thermodynamics problem moving forward can you tell me what is Agroforestry is a type of Sustainable agriculture that is being promoted where in the farming land crops are also grown while there are certain trees that are also grown alongside the boundaries of the farmland also contribute to the commercial aspect of the farming certain varieties of trees are there and it is called in Punjab that that contributes to the timber sales have you heard about the national Agroforestry policy is India's stand on the ongoing Israel Palestine conflict India has unequivocally condemned the hammer terrorist attacks while we give a leave a to Israel to successfully neutralize the terrorists now when civilian casualties are being there so India has supported the UN resolution that has called for humanitarian ceasefire immediately so following is the last question from my side will be what is the two state solution that has been prescribed to resolve this Israel Palestine conflict the two state solution a resolution of passed in 1948 in UN General Assembly that involved forming Two States of Israel and Palestine where Palestinian state will include is Jerusalem west bank and Gaza territory while rest of the territories will be of Israel just to conclude is India supporting the two state solution yes sir India's fully committed to two state solution however there has been a minor change like now we don't talk about Jerusalem is Jerusalem while on overall we are fully committed to two state solution two cases in the past in our country one is Nirbhaya case if we all know where the guilty person was convicted after years and then another case Hyderabad by the methodology followed in the Nirbhaya case was I will follow that because it was perfectly in line with the rule and as a police a person or as a part of Administration the constitution values the rule of law has to be followed anyhow we the police persons are no other administration person has the right to give instant justice for so Delhi method should be followed by certainly in India the huge pendency of cases leads to delay in justice but I believe that justice delivered anytime as per rule of law should be the case Punjabi Complex on the
