what do you mean by doubling the income of farmers you are from my West Bengal we do have national song and national anthem OK what is the difference between the two and what are the major industry which is in West Bengal do you think government should start taxing the agricultural income what are the issues that revolve around marital rape in India give a brief introduction about yourself as mentioned in my deaf my name is better than brought up in Ashoknagar of North 24 Pargana district of West Bengal I have done my schooling from Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya not 24 Pargana district itself thereafter I have done my graduation in the subject of Agricultural Science from visva Bharati University thereafter I have done my Masters in the subject of seed Science and technology from Orissa University of Agriculture and Technology Bhubaneswar Odisha after my means fortunately I got selected as West Bengal food safety officer however I have taken extraordinary leave without pay for this Interview preparation what does it mean to denote the climbers and Creepers the herbaceous plants study agriculture what are the graduation level and post graduation level must have acquired lot of expertise in agriculture the year 2016 Government of India decided to double the income of farmers isn't it but unfortunately could not be achieved my first question is what do you mean by doubling the income of farmers as mentioned in Ashok dalwai committee government proposes proposed doubling of farmers income by 2022 as I can remember as of now it means that it was brought by the government so that farmers income can be doubled the productivity of the land and productive crop productivity can be enhanced production level and yield can be enhanced simultaneously what happened wrong pandemic was one major reason due to which we could not achieve the success as we supposed to achieve I think government is doing at least trying to doing their best to enhance the farmers income answer I am hopeful that if not in the in this time but in the near future we will be able to achieve increasing the crop productivity could you suggest some measures one or two images there is a need to diversification the current model of Agricultural for diversification we can follow integrated farming system this can be one probable option thereafter sir I think we should follow the climate smart agriculture also so that we can the climate crisis in in agriculture at this moment of time set thereafter we can shift towards modern method for example said now farmers in most of the path farmers cultivating rice in the traditional way directly drive method in that we can introduce the modern methods introduction of method of Israel my Limited knowledge Israel being a country with most of the land covered and the desert areas they have invested in Muslim to enhance their irrigation model become self sufficient but I have also started exporting so what lessons could be take from the model so that our agricultural productivity also increases we should learn the way of water is efficiency they have adopted in their irrigation system we can follow the drip irrigation model that has been developed by Israel other than these sprinkler method and these equipments greenhouse equipments as of my knowledge greenhouse greenhouse equipments as these are transparent polythene sheets a house like structure which is which is prepared for the oxygen cultivation of the crops so that we show that in this method actually we allow the sunlight to enter so you are not West Bengal food safety officer very good and you have also been group leader what are the traits of a group leader there are many Threads but to mention some few I will put first the leadership skill there after time management skills thereafter a communication skills thereafter said engaging with everybody and also taking also being involved in the group activities so that the work can be distributed and work can be done by me along with them means participated in nature said this can be some magic trics of a group leaders are also we do have many traits of a good administrator ok so you have just some of the traits of being a good leader What are the differences between traits of a and a good administrator is there any difference sir I think as administration is a very broad concepts it needs to communicate with the people also along with the team members so I think administration skills also involves being empathetic being compassionate towards the people other than this I think sir more or less the group leader traits as mentioned comes also under administration but administration also includes these empathetic compassionate honesty integrity these things also comes as an administrative state videos in YouTube about innovations in the field of Administration what type of innovations we can have sir I would like to mention one news from today's newspaper Times of India only then I have found that AI technology is being used by Delhi Police only and recently they have used a technology for the reconstruction of a face of a dead body to make him in Alice position and in this way to the help of the air Technology Delhi police has was able to identify the criminals so I think air technology is being used as a new innovative model in the field of Administration and in the field of Agriculture and Technology food safety officer you will have the opportunity to use AI Technology I think that I said I have just joined and I have done the field training as of now sir only then after I have taken the extraordinary leave as per my Limited experiences I think that the collection of the data that I have seen during my field training that could be taken in a better manner using a technology in this way we can save our time and also in the if we will maintain the record then we can in future also we can have a detailed record using a technology but I think I need to go into the detail of the office work then only I can better utilise my knowledge what is the difference between the sorry sir I think I don't have any sufficient information to answer this question but if you love me I can take a gift one would be the differences regarding the author like our national anthem Jana Gana Mana is written by Rabindranath Tagore and national song Vande Mataram was written by Bankim Chatterjee and as of now usually National Anthem is being sung after at the end of the program or any initiatives our national song There is as of my knowledge there is no mandatory need to sing it after watching him after participating in any program moreover if I am not from National Anthem must be song within a particular time limit it's more than I think it's 52 seconds and around 52 only our as of my knowledge there is no time limitations to song to national song Vande Mataram you are from West Bengal have you heard our plane I am familiar with the term but I think it's in the western part of West Bengal but I don't have any detailed knowledge about this idea about the other plans comes under these are the parts of the land areas only have soils so what is the major difference between the Khadar soil and bhangar file at this moment of time one is a new aluminium and another is old aluminium and I can record and the Bangar is the reason in West Bengal this lies within the West Bengal and it is part of the Khadar film have you heard this chai Bagan time job what is it ok for the people who lives in the Northern portion North Eastern portion as sun rises earlier in that area so they face difficulties in accommodating their work schedule with IST that is Indian standard time zone so they had a demand that if they could have a different time zones so that they can schedule their works as per that that was a long standing debate regarding at the time of independence West Bengal was doing very great in the industrial output of our country but if you will see after that our industrial output have continuously decline what could be the major reason for that yes sir first major reason is the partition because after partition the jute growing areas got shifted to the Bangladesh regions and we the West Bengal portion only only only only only had the industry Industries so that is the one major reasons the second reason is the instability due to political valency and naxalism and all these all these related issues that is the social policies of the then Government and fourth is the lack of ease of doing business indicators and there is a lack of persuasion among the conception also among the business Industrialist regarding the West Bengal ease of doing business however I would also like to mention that west bengal government is doing at least trying to do to do best because now many industrial corridors are being developed for example Raghunathpur Dankuni Haldia region Industrial Corridor many industrial townships are being developed for example Jungle Mangal in the region of Purulia Raghunathpur only so I think the issues are now getting addressed and what are the major industry which is in West Bengal cement industry steel industry leather industry has also their industry one major problem is that we are growing jute WhatsApp the post harvest processing of the jute technologies are facing some major issues as of my knowledge of what is fiscal policy used to bring the fiscal policy in this policy revenue part means what will be the source of revenue revenue source of the government where government needs to be needs to have their expenditure these things are mentioned in the fiscal policy and through this policy also government try to maintain the money supply in the market distance policy it is also study of where are the revenue resources of the government is there any revenue resource that comes to the government via agricultural I think agricultural income is not being taxed as this moment of time so as of my knowledge I think it there is no mandatory requirement but I need to check on it so let's assume that you are correct and agricultural income is not taxed I guess that's also correct so in your opinion do you think government should start taxing the agricultural income or should I just be as it is going agricultural agricultural income will be taxed then it will definitely be a major source of revenue of the government but having said that as Indian their more than 80% of the farmers of India comes from the small and marginal background so if you will Agriculture Income then it will create another burden on the farmer themselves so I think I think I think I'm there will they we can have some alternate arrangement for example we can develop certain category so that so that through this category we can categorise farmers means whoever will be the big and medium farmers we can text them and we can leave behind small and marginal farmers so that their burden cannot be get increased also agricultural tax but with slabs is that correct and you know that the budget is around the corner so for agriculture what Expectations do you have from the interim budget what do you think should be the announcement in the interim budget for say some first will be the MSP I think the crops now covered by the MSP should be divisible diversified I think the amount of MSP that government is being provided as of now should be increased in climate for climate smart crops for example a pulses and millets should should have increased amount and second will be the government is already running a program regarding if you promotion that is farmer producer organisation I think there should also be an increase in the allocation of the budget so that in the long run we can address the issues of land fragmentation and all such things and third thing is I will be happy if government will also increase budget allocation for the climate resilient agriculture portion and also can incorporate for example integ farming system and allied allied products allied activities of agriculture in these things when we are talking about agriculture it's often said that irrigation is one of the concern in agricultural sector of India is that true to some extent it is true because now we are seeing that water crisis is being a major issue and already if I am not from NASA's groundwater report has already said that we are losing around 0.3m water groundwater table level every year so I think it is true and we should develop a certain strategies to improve water use efficiency so going by the information that you shared then why should India or why does India promote an exports crop like sugar Which are which need high amount of water for cult do you think it's a good strategy mam I think our export basket needs to be diversified as you have mentioned the virtual export of water is really a major issues as of now because sugarcane needs around 2000 litres of water for 1 to produce 1 kg of sugarcane and also rice also needs around so I think about export basket needs to be divisible diversified with less water intensive crops you have studied agricultural Science can you tell us what is the difference between pleiotropy and polygon Trophy as far as I can recall one gene can affect multiple interaction blue tone or contributing towards a particular inherited characteristics can you also give me one example of yes sir for example polygenic characteristics is in regarding the coat colours of animals and philosophy I think so its Sickle Cell anaemia things you have studied agriculture there is a unique system of agriculture in which farming is done below sea level do you know about it about low level farming systems like lowland cultivation in which part of India this is practice recently some of the officials of the enforcement directorate our Attack by a mob in the state of West Bengal do you know about this case incident has happened in my district only in sandeshkhali region around 15 days ago what was the issue there was one person and named Shah Jahan who was allegedly involved in the Russian scam case of West Bengal so area officials went into Powerpoint for a search and seizure of operation in sandeshkhali region unfortunately due to some miscommunication some local peoples they attacked ID officials according to you what can be done to ensure a smooth coordination between the central and the state Agencies so that such unfortunate events do not occur in future would be the protection of the ID officials or any Central Agencies like now also again area officials has done yesterday only so we have seen that how CRPF and now being provided for their protection other than this I think State Government and state police force needs to be facilitated the all the procedures taken up by the central Agencies and there should not be communication gap from both sides do you think such a loose behaviour by mob in effect tells us about the lawlessness in the state I will not exactly code lawlessness because our state government is doing many have taken many steps to improve the law and order situation for example recently many Police stations are being built women win a squad has been introduced for women's safety and all these things I think the local local man and woman needs to be added about these things prior hand what are the issues that revolve around marital rape in India 75 of IPC does not criminalize this offence and also government has also also have given their stand because as it is a matter of subjective interpretation that we cannot dec exactly that when the consent is being withdrawn hence we cannot directly criminalize it sir I also share this view but at the same time I think that the physical assault faced by the woman needs to be condemned and moreover if the if these issues are happening in the present time in the 21st century the core issues need to be addressed because if a man or woman doing such genius crime he or she may be facing any psychological trauma for example there are issues Anti Social disorder nurses syndromes so I think we should have a vigorous awareness campaign regarding this recently are honorable minister of external affairs has authored the book by Bharat matters so according to you why Bharat should matter book tell me in general context there is an ongoing debate between India versus Bharat so what is your take on it I don't have any personal information to any of these name which whichever name will serve the national interest will be favoured by me also how was if anybody is if anybody is fabric the word Bharat I think that would be also good because it's not imported it's an indigenous name because we can see reference of Bharat in our ancient text also solution to Teesta river water dispute only one possible solution is enough debits and discussions and both the all three parties west bengal government Bangladesh is that water comes and comes under the state subject as per schedule 7 of Indian constitution second is the north Bengal population west bengal government is much concerned about their North Bengal population if we will distribute major river portion of Teesta river portion to Bangladesh then it will hamper the north Bengal populations livelihood and their agricultural activities that's why government of West Bengal has taken this answer Chief Minister of West Bengal women inspirational like Bengali is known for its diversity for colour for festival and being a leader of diversified state wearing white saree with blue colours and spending her all as a as a political leader that inspires me a lot Sir nice interact with you comment interview at the very outset that you are an excellent candidate excellent candidate and the limited time ask you question on variety of subjects and you are absolute answers abstract convention sudden things I have yourself noticed you have to take care of those areas mind it that's interviews for selection of Civil Servant is not a quiz competition question answer session isn't it so while asking questions and the way you respond answering to those questions try to look at various aspects of your personality to the 345 aspects of your personality the first and foremost your personal integrity a personal integrity and honesty of purpose the way you answer questions that if we are giving answers based on information based on your intellect it's alright but if you are giving your answers based on some images on conjectures and guess problem so you did not hazard a guess but make sure that when you go for the interview that doesn't happen if you don't know doesn't matter speak only when you know if you have a domain knowledge if you have information or if the situation based questions or something we can think of then go for it otherwise fracture information should be yes or no no guessing OK then your answers have to be very very balance because you are coming from straight line West Bengal lottery contains the situations are there between the centre and the state and all that some questions may be asked the uncomfortable questions may be asked there you have to maintain your equilibrium your presence of mind and your balance sheet is very important for you don't take an extreme view in favour of a particular setup OK then you have studied agriculture recently have been selected also in the west bengal government so and you have not joined so I don't think questions related to food and supplies will be asked but never know food what will be your job when you want to join as food safety of food safety officer what do you mean by food safety why would have a safety that kind of thing you should be at least having an understanding of what you are going to be dealing with once you join there is one then agriculture is a vast area and so many issues are there we try to again when we talk of MSP MSP is derived at the formula that committee committee and all that those things she should be fully aware then various schemes launched by the government completely like fasal Bima Yojana general questions like who pays for the insurance and all that that should be known to you isn't it is a good practice or you wanted to change by some other Yojana and all that then your routing of subsidies weather it should be given directly to the farmers because you see the questions will be not theoretical in nature It will be basically a fact opinion based routing of what is the existing system exactly what should be the solution is it fine working fine or you want something just to understand you as a person whether you can think of issues are not physically to that about the name about operation Greens on so far is the longest so you prepare all that that is one part of it agricultural why water problem is there in that context only drip irrigation concept of drip irrigation and all that Israel bottle of agriculture that is also very relevant for you that is one part of it another part is your own state West Bengal Teesta river is one issue illegal migration is another big issue and all that you have to have a very clear view on all that then your nrc is another issue questions on nrc and all that but you have to have a very balanced view all this you can't be saying this is wrong this is right is always a great between black and white smuggling in Bangalore West Bengal is facing then industrial growth why it is not happening in Bengal why industries are running away from Bengal I am going to states like Gujarat and all so reasons for that then you are North Bengal and Central Bank Of Bengal why one area is elected by the other at the cost of the Other area those very general type of questions then you must have heard about Misty and all that read very carefully because in the state of West Bengal only so about the River system and all that Ganga Cruise is there environmental concerns and all questions if you are able to prepare all this apart from this international affairs we did not ask any questions but our relationship with Bhutan our relationship with Nepal our recent is used in Maldives and all that new Bhojpuri clear on all that and then what are the Government of India's policies to deal with diplomatically with the international players including what is happening in Russia Ukraine and all that Canada America recently so you have to have complete brief ready on all those issues prepare all this I think you will be able to very good presentation of yourself when you go for the interview and you have confidence maintain that confidence your communication skill is good maintain that communication skill and go with a smile on face and a positive body language never let your energy level Godown even if you don't know one two three answer last but not the least two things to introduce yourself why did you say as you are deaf and all that I am so start with that so that is one hope you are not going to the interview with quote and all that no code West Bengal feeling very cold here wearing saree online know something about the saree with you are going to wear that is why Limited I have asked for you guess so that is how it should be when you there is no clarity in your mind if you don't know beyond any Shadow of dark then you should seek permission with all humility sir I can attempt provided you allow me to waiting you may want to read the agricultural portion of that economics go hand in hand so some questions may be related to economy also may not be agriculture only allied sector Industry all inclusive to make a study of this what is happening the country on economic front overall record what should be my thought regarding the budget agriculture my points interim budget they will be no big policy change it will be a continuation thing so you were you can talk about general staff and you can when you talking you can like you bought out that issue of water usage in rice and sugar very well so if they ask you can develop regarding the like Sandesh Khan incidents and all this controversial issues like it not happen in third person don't don't be a party to any of the issues because you have whatever knowledge you have acquired only through reading of newspapers and all that always try to be third person mind it you are going to be a bureaucrat a Civil Servant if you have a preconceived notion right now itself and to deal with the situation of West Bengal and these things that if you are in the place if you are pm is also called in your cm is also called words and spirits of law I will not get entrance tuition of the Prime Minister or institution of the Chief Minister I am a bureaucrat I am supposed to carry out the job as a content in rule books by the rule book I will not get precise that is basically these are the questions asked to see whether you buckle under pressure or not emotional question basically you are strong or not be strong and be again neutral any number of rules and pretty sure once I got there
