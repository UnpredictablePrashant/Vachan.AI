why have you opted for a subject like economics and IIT graduate topic for economics why electoral bonds are criticized how India is fearing as far as economic diplomacy is concerned there has been a change in government in Maldives so why it has become a challenge for India now good afternoon please give a brief introduction my name is Rupak Sharma my father was in the army I lived in six different states and eight different schools and informal graduation yt Delhi I did my mechanical engineering there graduated in 2016 thereafter I worked in three different companies one was an MNC and two different start why did you quit your job I wanted to pursue civil services full time first of all I try to manage it with the job but then it got a little take and it was showing on my physical and mental health so I decided to take a break and give my complete effort to Civil Services good for weight if you don't make it even sure that the end of the day what is your call back plan to the corporate sector I have good experience I have good network I can always go back getting back is not an issue it should not be an issue I am quite confident the most I have lived in a town is daily daily per subject like economics and IIT graduate topic for economics I enjoyed my time in IIT and as I said I started my civil services preparation after 3 years graduating from IIT so I tried to figure out what we would add most value to me I figured being going for civil services Economics is a subject which is currently of great importance and its importance is Only Gonna Get higher Indian economy grows besides that is my personal preference was economics because I had done a few courses in college and I found the subject very interesting is the problem of slums why slums is a major issue in Delhi the reason is lot of migrants come to Delhi for jobs the fundamental reason behind that is not able to generate enough jobs in densely populated states like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar so lot of people come here the second reason is the Property rates both for buying as well as rent are fairly high in all Metropolitan cities in India therefore the migrants who have very low earnings are forced to live in slums the first state of Delhi how do you deal with problems of slum localities first of all I will try to encourage or push the schemes which try to build affordable housing like pm Aawas Yojana is trying to do that already I'll try to allocate as much funds to that as possible and try to ensure that the work gets expedited secondly I'll try to promote CSR as seen in hql where I worked companies do a lot of CSR projects and one a part of it is also affordable housing these are the two main players I would like what do you mean by word CSR corporate social responsibility when does it happen so it happens it's mandated by legislation in India where every company has to spend 2% of its profits on socially responsible projects which can range from cleanliness affordable housing education this kind of every company respective of its earnings irrespective of its turnover some restrictions for some conditions that I am not very sure but I don't think there is any cap on earnings it's just that the company should be making profits you must have heard about the issues of landfills in Delhi all located in Delhi and around Delhi what is the Ghazipur area where landfill the biggest landfill is located is a mountain of garbage species what the government has been doing about it not very sure about the exact status for the waste in landfills can be reused the firstly first step that is necessary in any waste management is segregation of waste so if that is done then things become much easier for example organic waste can be used to generate biofuels biogas which can subsequently be used to generate energy where is plastic can be recycled to a very high percentage I am guessing its over 80% the plastic can be recycled good good energy is another way where we can recycle or waste its basically converting waste into energy in different forms just as I said organic waste can be converted into biofuels then basically every form of waste can be also incinerated as the last resort if you burn the waste and use it to run a turbine you can generate electricity from them can you please define rights for me what are rights sir rights are things that we are allowed to do within the power of the law or it is the demand there is always a boundary in which right should be exercised and loss are what formed ok so keeping in mind the rights of the communities especially lgbtqia class right and it was of course the matter was admitted in the supreme court and the supreme court of course refuse to acknowledge the rights of marriage now what is opinion that whether the marriage must be recognised as the right for individual because of course you have identified given rights you have something called the transgender community so why the rights related to marriage has not been recognised and what is your opinion in this regard marriage is not just an individual right it's a social institution and especially in the context of India all religions plays a very important role to marriage in their context therefore Supreme Court has to find that it's a social issue and therefore interfering it with it just on the basis of individuals rights would not be the right thing to do what is your in the idea of progressive society like India what is your opinion that whether it should be given marriage right of course transgender have been acknowledged or they have been given rights right but there are other communities which are of course after 90 Singh Johar judgement you might have read about it but what about marriage right right didn't even have right to adopt children right to go on the property right and also they don't have right to marriage so these are the basic requirements and basic necessity now I am just talking about in the perspective of human or the values of human society now do you really think that India has to be disregarding the aspiration of the people because that is how is considered to be the foundation of our rights are nothing but they are the Bible and just demands of the individual so do you think that this should be rectified certain adoption divorce all these rights are not currently being practiced by lgbtq community my personal opinion is that instead of interfering with the marriage in we can have a civil Union instead of marriage and enact a new law which covers the LGBT community excellent now because you are also happened to be a student of Economics now population politics says of course playing the nation in fact the channel chairman of the finance Commission also expressed his apprehension about the Freeway culture that is of course playing the nation right now happen to have witnessed Sri Lankan crisis so what we can learn from the crisis that happened in Sri Lanka what India can learn the specifically about Sri Lanka it was populism that brought down their economy should learn that we should build a policy with long term considerations not just immediate election that is the first thing we can learn secondly another big problem was their abrupt ship to shift to organic farming we should do proper due diligence even if it's a good policy measure we should also always try to work out the ground reality is first and then do implementation ok my last question why electoral bonds are criticized electoral bonds are criticized because they reduce transparency in electoral funding the details of the donors are not in the public domain so you don't really know which large which are the largest donors for a particular details are not disclosed because it may suffer or it may undergo some kind of the donors are actually the donor details are disclosed any government who so ever is going to come in power sometimes victimise the person who is going to donate it now my question is there is of course because you are economic student and there is an apprehension related to the Companies Act the amendment in the Companies Act which has criticize the aspiration of electoral Bond why why these things have been criticized you have any idea Have you read about it not specifically about the Companies Act but the lack of disclosure is the main issue you have interest in Indian startup ecosystem what kind of impact will G20 summit that has happened in India have one Indian startup ecosystem G20 was very strongly emphasized on the brand of India so the meetings were held all over the country brand India was promoted different delegates were taken across the country I think that will help India first Indian startup ecosystem by firstly bringing in foreign investment so this year we see the funding to start up his start a little bit so with G20 behind us now I feel that will go up in the coming years that is one secondly we also tried to have many meetings or working related to economic issues financial issues and Entrepreneurship as well you are a student of Economics you must have studied marks and showed better have you not into much detail but yes my happy birthday talk about decline of capitalism do you know what they talk about I mean what do they say when they talk about decline of capitalism certainly they emphasize on the evil aspect of capitalism capital is exploit the working class then it would lead to a violent Revolution I feel globally it has proven that capitalist system is what has been successful in generating wealth and provided that capitalism is conscious and ethical then it is a sustainable model so if capitalist system ensures Welfare of the workers carries out CSR activities due to capitalism BC rising inequalities all across the world the Sooner Or Later the fault lines will emerge right now yes inequalities have reason especially in developing countries where only a section of society initially benefit from capitalism but we also seen let's say in South East Asian countries where capitalism has succeeded in redistributing that wealth over time that cryptocurrency or Bitcoins specifically inherently deflationary in nature that's not really true because until now we have not allowed the use of Bitcoin extensively in open markets for buying things buying goods but going ahead if we allow that then it would behave similar to the normal currencies that we use Nobel Prize in Economics was given to a woman do you know her name seems to sleep my mind but yes she talked about how women's participation in labour force and wages that women have received has varied over varied over the centuries shell that using the data how women's participation was fairly high before Industrial Revolution then it came down during the industrial revolution because the nature of the word essay in long run year old dad do you agree with the statement is important we need to learn classical economist close that long run is what we should focus on where a schema said that in long run we are all dead and therefore we should why you don't we should always have one eye on the short run but the other I should always be on the long run because only we think about the long run then we can think about the larger picture where we want our economy to go should we stay agrarian should be moved to the industrial sector 30 years down the line what should I economy will looking like for example today we are trying to push the emerging Technologies so that is something long run should look at a mechanical engineer from one of the premier institutes of India right now I have you not opted a job in any of the core sectors core engineering sectors have gone to hql then some startups I really enjoyed my mechanical engineering training when I dec set for placements HUL is what I have found to be a good mix of both managerial capabilities as well as core application so if I want to go in a little bit of detail at H U L I worked in multiple factories and I worked on several core projects as well ok you are production yes also something from economics nowadays we have seen that the diplomacy is changing from the ideological diplomacy to economic diplomacy right how India is fearing as far as economic diplomacy is concerned putting our interest on a table or not the certainly are doing well on the economic diplomacy front I'll give you a few examples during Russia Ukraine war we decided to purchase continue purchasing oil from Russia despite pressure from the west that was considering the fact that oil prices were already high in the market and we were getting good discounts from Russia which help us keep our inflation slow in Economics in classical theories it is also said that markets have a self correcting mechanism what despite of that we have seen markets failing several times so why markets failed what are the reasons behind it the markets fail because of the underlying assumptions in classical theory are not always true example classical theories believe that wages are perfectly variable that is not the case in labour markets wages are set as per labour contracts and for example there are stringent labour laws in India which often hamper free movement of the market right and who are the monitors as far as Economics is concerned the monitor is the most prominent name being Milton friedman they argue that money is the most important factor in the economy the money supply that is what determines the price level and economic growth in the short as well as in the long run right when suppose you become a Civil Servant right which kind of pension system will you opt for the defined contributory kind of pension define benefit kind of pension that is new pension or old pension which will be your preferred choice will be the new pension scheme so what is the economics behind these pension scheme as you said the new pension scheme is contributory where while you are working you have to contribute a part of your salary to a fund which is invested in diversified Markets and according to the returns on those funds you are paid up pension so that pension might not be fixed dependent variable depending on the returns and on those months whereas the old pension there was no contribution by the working person and entire payment was done by the Government's budget that was the main difference and the reason I feel new pension scheme should be favoured is because it reduces the burden on the X checker you already see 57 to 60% of our defence budget is spent on salaries and pension and only a very less than 30% we are able to spend on capital expenditure we want to rationalize these things in the line last question to you is that you have been participating in some of the debates also right you have been a speaker so as per you what should be some points of ethics that should be taken care while debating for a motion or against the motion ethical points of considerations the first and foremost would be the accuracy of we should be accurate with what we say and we should also be accurately with what we are missing out in news media VC these days that a lot of facts are conveniently made out to portray a certain narrative that we should avoid we should give the complete picture in whatever debates we undertake secondly the kind of emotions we want to invoke in the listeners persuasive speaking can be a double edged sword so if a leader who has purchased skills is it then it can even need to write so that is these are the two things we should keep in mind while making government in Maldives so why it has become a challenge for Indian Army movies who has taken over as the new president of Maldives and even during his campaigning period he was supporting the India out movement whereas the previous Regime was of India first policy and it is also said that the new dispensation is pro China so that creates concerns for India do you think like we should not get to much associated with the government in power in any country because whenever there will be a change in government it will lead to maybe some adverse consequences for India like we should be engage more in domestic politics of our neighbouring countries or less my opinion is that we should actively engage with both parties or all parties in are neighbourhood especially because if we restrained China is not going to restraint is going to take one side or both sides and try to ensure that the side which they have ever come to come stop elections in Argentina new president has taken charge and he is known as the mad man so what is his philosophy I am not very weird of your Mechanical Engineer so we are hearing a lot about the EVS electric vehicles and it is being cited as something that will help us in dealing with the pollution issue what do you think we are actually that clean for environment IC engine vehicles we are using right now because they do not directly burn the fuel so in mechanical engineering are changing the source of pollution if are electricity is coming from thermal power plant is coming but again we are trying to reduce that and move to solar power and wind what is the difference between phase down and phase out of coal price down is where we need to reduce coal in our energy makes gradually where is facing out is a straight deadline by which we will complete it is India on India is on freezing down side because we have a developmental needs economic growth needs now when we talk about FDA is so India doesn't have a very good track record in making or taking benefit of FT is the data science with various countries so is the problem with the ft is the problem with us I think the problem was the way we negotiated those activities and the situation Indian economy was in when we negotiated to safety most of the FPS we signed in work in 1990 or early 2000 that was when Indian economy was still very small and negotiation power was not that great that is why we had to give more leave it to other countries which led imports rising and exports not growing so much ok now you also have interest in golf yes sir I read somewhere that golf has too much walking yes to be a good game and just enough game to is Bollywood walk so with what you agree more depends on your day if you playing well then it's a good work and if you not playing well it seems like the longest walk you never have generally believed in our country that ghost is played by only rich people in our country how could you develop the interest in rich game really very expensive gift is expensive equipments are expensive cities in the army so that allowed me and my younger brother to pursue Golf at a very young age join any club to play golf for I used to sir in school I had a lot of time because it's a time consuming game so I played in army clubs wherever my father was posted in but of late I have not been able to stay in touch with the game last question to you start up we ask you questions what do you think startup ecosystem today is really robust and vibrant or its dwindling it has improved if we see the last decade performance the startup ecosystem of India has really grown in terms of number of startups and number of unicorns are the amount of funding that startups have been raising or even the enthusiasm of youngsters to do startups on all friends we have improved but as you set a certainly there are challenges that we need to tackle for example recently the funding has gone down in the last year then some unethical issues like byju's came to light using an ethical practices to grow so there are certainly challenges but startup ecosystem has done really well in the last decade can you think of areas in the government where startups can really help the government in running the business certainly even the company I worked at urban company we used to train our professional service professionals and we used to listen with ministry of skill development to give them RPL certificate which is recognition of prior learning this shows that government is also trying to build skill of the workforce and its win win for both basically Government and the start of government did not still its own employees but depend on startup company to render its services and support we can take the example of Farm game it's a Startup in the AI sector which is using artificial intelligence to improve farm productivity by measuring different water levels nutrient levels in the soil and using Precision agriculture basically what do you mean by startup bubble startup bubble is similar to the financial bubble that we haven't had in 2008 so if too much funding flows into startups and valuations become inflated to suddenly that bubble can burst one day and that can disrupt the investor confidence and harm harm the startups even the good one that is danger that we should be very thank you very much for you ok and first interview how was today's experience it was good I felt comfortable any could you access your performance quickly from the feedback I received at tried to be a little calm and not just shoot of the block right after the question that is what I was playing other than that I felt the questions I answered well the content that is willing also suggestions only you have to restrict your hand movement it comes naturally to one I can understand that for those 30 minutes that will itself remind you that you don't have to open communication communicate your ideas your views your point of view very clearly and confidently that certain places again it is slip of tongue only I will give you a few examples so instead of saying I'll give you because speaks of your authority I'll give you for example can I give a few examples that kind of registration I am telling if you are confronted with this kind of situation try to make doesn't cost and appreciated your student of Economics if it is supported by some data right how much you because you see what you said just like that spontaneously that's when the defence sector 70% of salaries paid to the Employees and 30% is left for the capital of one element of your revenue expenditure so many expenditure so many other things are there so you can't be security segregating into two distinct compartment one is salary and other is capital so that kind of created this kind of an impression with the revenue expenditure and capital expenditure supported by some that so much and all that Government of India when you say is better you body consolidated fund of India in student think that is consolidated fund of India it goes through that and as it is it is the burden is staggering on the government logical corollary may be that then why the state governments are going back to the pension scheme for the state governments are so we have to prepare for that also why it is not a good economics may be a good political politics what is not a good Economics that kind of thing you have excellent credit note qualities a product of IIT we asked question on variety of issues and you could try to address those issues to the best of your abilities and very convincingly also that is very good only thing is somebody may try to Grill you on the Golf and all that you said that my father was in the army and that's why I got an opportunity is not otherwise the government sector in today's match startup and all that you are very clear about that they are also if you can as a student of Economics figure out the rate at which the start of success succeed in India how many die natural death and how many survive and different stages of from starting from PC to series abc where just for way of reminder otherwise have confidence in yourself believe in yourself stay cool calm composed before giving answers collect your thoughts for a while to suggest seconds and then you come out with the solutions of the ideas of the answers which you think
