lack of industrialisation coupled with growing unemployment in West Bengal have resulted in massive dependence of the people of West Bengal on government schemes not do you think the contribution of Subhash Chandra Bose is ignored in the history what exactly are Western disturbance hear it so often but what exactly was there is a very famous painting called as Shrirampur by Hooghly river right do you have any idea about this painting who is known as the bird of Bengal TV seated thank you please give a brief introduction about yourself so my name is Anushka Sarkar I did my schooling from Saint Joseph Convent Chandannagar my I was born and brought up in the Hooghly district Shrirampur the town of Shrirampur I did my under graduation in geography from the lady brabourne college under the University of Calcutta and then I did my Masters in development studies from the National Institute of Technology in Rourkela Sirsa what do you want to join the civil services I think it would be a good fit for my personality I like to mix with different kinds of people I like to work with people answer the social respect and The Prestige as well as the job security is something that is desirable to me you are from West Bengal isn't that generally believed that lack of industrialisation coupled with growing unemployment in West Bengal have resulted in massive dependence of the people of West Bengal on government schemes agree with this view unfortunately it is true that in the recent past few decades that have been much the industrialization of West Bengal and there is unemployment to the extent that many of the youth of West Bengal are moving to different states and going to Bangalore or Pune for jobs so as far as the dependence on government schemes is concerned West Bengal economy is mainly agricultural now so to support that Income since agriculture is quite a seasonal employment and also the Urban Development is focused mainly in Kolkata there is dependence on government schemes as well as income boosters like the lokkhi Bhandar screenshot West Bengal political violence has a historical background to search for example the novel movement has been one of the Origins of political violence in the present times since the ruling party at the centre and the state are different so sometimes there is a conflict between their ideologies and ideas so it is sometimes we see that there is violence in West Bengal if you look at the Panchayati Raj institution selections which was held in the state of West Bengal is the recent past hundreds of people died due to violence why there is Madness from the people of different use and colours to have an access and control over the Panchayati Raj institutions in West Bengal Institutions at the grassroot level they have quite a lot of resources at their disposal and unfortunately the sum of the leaders the grassroot level they might want to use these resources for their personal benefits and that is why they want to hold on to the power so to say what are the sources of funds for the Panchayati Raj Institutions the Panchayati Raj Institutions funds are mainly from the state government and so there are also schemes from the central government that gives funds to the panchayats for local development of Panchayati Raj institutions in West Bengal how effective it has been in empowering the women of rural West Bengal first and experience of village life in West Bengal since I have grown up in towns in cyber child what's the West Bengal women have been hist they have had more important than the rest of the many parts of the rest of the country and the Panchayati Raj institutions have given the reservation of Women in these institutions and that has helped them to an extent empower themselves or have a say in the governance at the local level so I would say that that is at an institutional level it is a good step but it also has to be supported by social sensitization or gender sensitization against the patriarchal control of the family and this can be done through I think education is a good way Bengal specially Kolkata regarded as one of the safest City for womens there is a recent report of the ncrb has said that Calcutta is the safest city in terms of women violence against women it is true that I think both two factors contribute to this one that there is in fact less violence in Calcutta against women in some angles such as there is good why there is less or crimes on one hand and on the other hand sir also there is some less reporting that is done in West Bengal so on both sides one is a positive side one is a negative side but these two combined to form the numbers Meri recently the few years back Bengal elections happened I believe Panchayati Raj elections are also around the corner in Bengal elections happened yes why Bengal is relatively seen so much post Paul violence or why it is seen that postponed victimization of the candidate is happening too much in Bengal or the violence associated with the election why what is wrong with the administration what is wrong with the electoral practice in Bengal has formed a sort of culture of political violence in West Bengal where in the parties even At The Grass root level the party workers are quite radical in their support to the party and intolerant of the other ideologies and other Party song Party workers are violent in party workers are equal in the spirit of a political party but why Bengal particularly as seen so much of postponed violins this the culture of violence has been seen from the top level To The Grass root level so I think the conflict at the top level leadership has Trickle down to the grassroot level to a large extension was effectively tackled in West Bengal but what we have seen is a sharp rise again in the in the field of naxalism now what are the factors in which we have seen that the naxalism is of course moving forward and there of course happens to be a sharp rise in the areas of especially West Bengal Northern West Bengal what do you in that perspective the elements of left wing extremism have occurred in West Bengal again so to speak because of several factors such as there is a quite a lot of regional inequality within West Bengal sir for example the development is quite concentrated around in and around Kolkata where is some of the northern districts are not ignored but they have been they feel that they have been left Behind to an extent around Kolkata only the development is that the British developed Kolkata for their own trade interest and treated the Hinterland as only a source of resources and so that has continued post independence unfortunately ok my last question how do you think the contribution of Subhash Chandra Bose is ignored in the history so I would not say that the contribution of Netaji is ignored in history because all of the freedom fighters no matter what their means and what their ideas they had one goal of that of the independence of India national when do we celebrate the birth anniversary of Subhash Chandra Bose 23rd of January but this is what and when is the salary when we do we celebrate the birth anniversary of Jawaharlal Nehru so 14th of November when do we celebrate the birth anniversary of Gandhiji 2nd of October in the context of birth anniversary even the popularizing the famous figures like you can save actively taken part in the freedom struggle movement don't you think it is deliberately ignored by some individuals the role of Subhash Chandra Bose even the learning people like you are not even aware that what was the birth how do we celebrate birth anniversary of Subhash Chandra Bose why what possible reason do you find out Subhash Chandra Bose is contributions have been ignored it is possible that since a lot of his contributions were based from abroad rather than working with the masses like Gandhiji and Nehru it is possible that his contribution are less visible to some of the sum of the population but his contributions in history are not ignored and cannot be used when last question yes all well monument by Subhash Chandra Bose was against the horrible monument so I have not heard about this you have Geography optional which was the recent cyclone to hit India it is called which country is experiencing cold wave severe cold wave what is the definition of a cold wave so I do not know the technical definition of a cold waves so cold waves can happen for some various reasons in different parts of the world in Delhi for example for during the winters it is firstly it is a continental place which is quite far away from the moderating influence of the sea so that is one factor as well as the Western disturbances have an impact on bringing the gold that come from the region of the Mediterranean and the Caspian Sea they are cyclonic in nature and so they are part of the Western jet stream that the southern branch of the Western jet stream that so there to be playing for the cold wave right so they are to be majorly blame for the cold wave sorry West Bengal when is Bangladesh celebrated shirt is celebrated on the 21st of February and what is the significance of that day so it is I am not sure of this but it is one of the significance is that of the mother language day but celebrated around the 14th of April Bangladesh is going to be celebrated recently west bengal government has come out with this it is the Bangladesh is celebrated on the case and what is the state song that has been selected I cannot I read it but I cannot remember at the moment the song is written by Rabindranath Tagore song recently there has been a controversy over the visva Bharati University which has become a UNESCO World Heritage site right what was the controversy so one of the controversy was regarding the conflict of the VC versus about a piece of land right from that there have been I think political the students have raise their voices against the chancellor of visva Bharati University the chancellor is the governor you can look it up when we talk about international relations so Bangladesh is a very important labour for us and sometimes it has happened that Indian Bangladesh are ready to decide a resolve an issue but the west bengal government has not been ok with that right so what what is that issue river water sharing not agreeing to that water sharing plan state in the in case of the Teesta it is we are worried that the water sharing will give us less water resources for the northern parts of West Bengal which is already from where originates from which glacier in which state I cannot remember the state I do not know the Glacier name answer the state I think it is Sikkim but I cannot write a final question to you there is going to be election in Bangladesh ok so you need to tell me which are the two Important political party is there and who is going to become the next Prime Minister of Bangladesh one of the political parties is the awami league The Other main opposition party I cannot remember answer the next the next leader is for the Bangladeshi people you are from Shrirampur West Bengal and you love painting there is a very famous painting called as Shrirampur by Hooghly river right do you have any idea about this painting in the Indian mus Kolkata but I cannot remember that national Museum of Denmark maybe the copy will be there so it might be the case but why this painting is that Denmark what is connection of Denmark with Serampore was initially a drainage Colony and after 1845 it was sold to the British the colony was sold to the British East India company and Denmark and Shrirampur have a deep connection for example of few years back the drainage government took up the top of the initiative to restore some of the dangerous architecture in Shrirampur for example a tower is there Central Church student of developmental economics right Kolkata is some of the critics they say that Kolkata is a Maurya band City so as a student of developmental studies what is your take on it so unfortunately I would have to say that compared to some of the Other metro cities of India Kolkata is stagnating one of the reasons is that some indicators to show stagnation of Kolkata indicates I can think of the industrialization then the youth of Kolkata are usually leaving for different states so even demographically it is an aging City infrastructure is old and it needs reason for example the recent controversy about whether or not to continue with the terms of these are some of the indicators but I think that with a little bit of effort Kolkata can be revived because it is the most important Metro city in Eastern India server right my next question to you is that Bangladesh is very close right Bangladesh is just like a twin sister of Bengal West Bengal what is the relevance of West Bengal for Bangladesh for India Bangladesh has been historically a very good friend of us and we have helped Bangladesh to achieve liberation from Pakistan it has the longest border with India and so Bangladesh the relationship with Bangladesh has to be kept on friendly terms for examples India is contributing to developmental areas of Bangladesh to oppose China's influence for example then so we also have some lessons to learn from Bangladesh from the angle of sperm in women empowerment for example of the Gramin Bank experience one of the challenges that Bangladesh poses is that of the illegal immigrants that come to India I am giving your case study which is very important with your state that suppose you are posted as a commissioner of police of Kolkata right now you have to investigate a certain case right your state government the top leadership is giving you instruction a union government is giving you instruction B both are in Clash of each other what you will do state the case I would try to take an impartial investigation which shouldn't be on the basis of instructions that I received from both the states because after the investigation has to be in public interest and I would I would do what is best for in that sensor right my last question to you is you do experimental cooking what kind of cooking so what are you doing some International cooking shows on TV or online and then I try to modify it or change it on the basis of the ingredients available in the markets around me or at home and it turns into that tell me four or five specific spices for specific things which are I mean speciality of a traditional Bengali food and which is not present in any other food so I wouldn't say this spices are not available not used in any other business I think mustard oil is one there is also the spices we use fish in a lot of dishes in different ways than the rest of the world Anushka you have studied Geography can you tell us that how geographical factors influence the gender based division of labour physical factors can influence the gender based division of labour in a sense that for example in desert Areas where water is quite scars the responsibility of fetching water from a false mainly on the shoulders of women so that is something that that is an example of how Geography can influence how labour is divided between men and women is it a social reason or a geographical reason man can also go out and fetch water for that matter of a geographical and social reason because water in general has been the responsibility of water has been put on women in most parts of the world historically so this also has a social patriarchal angle to it but Geography is also a big part of exam you see Himalayas act as a natural divide between India and China so according to you who has more advantage of Himalayas India or China India has an advantage in the sense that it is a very prominent defence barrier so the Chinese for example the military cannot easily attack India on this site but from the angle of utilising the Himalayas I would say China has the greater advantage since the slope of the Himalayas on that side on the Northern side is less steep than this side and also so reverse that originate in the Himalayas originate on that side so they have the greater advantage as a upper iPad in state you have studied developmental studies also so can you tell us who is a leader so one definition not a definition but a description that I read of a leader by Henry kissinger is that a leader is somebody who takes people from where they have not been to the Future so so to me a leader somebody who can envision the future what we do not see now and lead the people to follow a vision considering the present situation of our society who do we need more good leaders or good managers sir I think we need good leadership more because the leader is the one who sets the vision so that is more of a innate quality that of leadership but some managers can be trained because it is a skill that can be learnt so if we have a good leader we can have we can train good managers can you tell us what is the toughest decision that you have taken in your life till now so the toughest decision I wouldn't say it was the toughest decision but it was a very significant decision was that whether person in my personal life is that whether I would continue towards Academics or try for civil services can you tell us some of the factors that influence decision making various cases of decision making tell me in the order of their priority just give me three reasons sir finance is in general for any decision making I think finances social acceptability and personal personal wishes my final question to you who is known as the bird of Bengal I do not know the song what was his real name Rabindranath Thakur aur Rabindranath Tagore is how it is pronounced in Bangla and Rabindranath Tagore is the English version of the same name and he wrote it differently when he wrote in Bengali versus in English Calcutta is having India's first underwater metro to must have heard about it what is the features of this metro how is going to help the computers of Kolkata so this is a very unique thing that is there in Kolkata the Metro line traverses the Ganges river and it is scientifically very interesting to me so it will help the computers of Kolkata because the a lot of the people who work in Kolkata come from the other side of the river for example the cities of Howrah or even Shrirampur and Chandannagar so it will help in faster commute is your commute laser breaks in the journey and what is taking better at station code is played and going to Sealdah such a passenger gets benefited by the introduction of this underwater Metro how is travel time reduces or doesn't reduce or increase definitely reduce because it will reduce for both the people going in the metro as well as the people travelling by roads because will decrease it can be thought that it will decrease the traffic over the roads also and decrease the travel time for somebody going from S plan to share the because that is quite a congested area especially in the officers answer thank you 12th attempt and first means and first time first interview so how did you like your interaction today with us it was informative manage to fall terribly sick as soon as I came to Delhi so my energy levels are quite so I thought I will be slow member asking for my permission this is not the etiquette when you enter you enter you should enter read the board members understand there you can't miss it or not just be patient to get an instruction from the chairman will ask you to sit down then you take a sentence you are a girl from West Bengal and West Bengal lot of interest questions on condensation issues try to take a balanced view on everything dislikes and distillation is a problem it's a reality unemployment is a reality your political killing is a reality is reality and you should not feel tired of mentioning those things but whenever you try to end it and it with a Ray of light why do you see the decline the jute Industries ok so that is could be one because on the industrialization this type of questions may be as a traditional Industries with the West Bengal was having most of jute Industries have going to that site Bangladesh site whatever is there why those industries are not getting advocate attention from the state government make a note on that and give a brief in the evaluation of social programs skills like kanyashree and what do you call the lucky lucky what are the impact of all those schemes launched by the government may ask you why Kolkata is safe for women how could I have answered that question but do you think number one is it is it safe for women or not so I would say some facts don't compare with other cities saying that the safest there must be some some some indices based on which this question has been asked just look at the indices why it is called women and even if you don't have the necessary input you can as a person of Commerce and think of the reasons why it is natural respect linked to the cultural behavioral aspects of the people of Calcutta traditionally people of Kolkata has been very good and then crying look at the crime I don't have the figures with me look at the crime report how the crimes are you said because less filing of fire is that so if you pass this kind of a statement you have to very sure about that nobody asked you I am not questioning you are wisdom if it is true then you go ahead actually mentioned to us I will I am part of the state government initiative for the Civil Services training and Senior Police official they mention this I have told you or student who is going for the serious kind of personal right your argument should be based on pure data will say how do you say that a fires are not getting lost there on what basis are giving the statement this is not my condition my view this is based on so also reports also report that you have enough evidence of data available speaking that what is going to the implication of the statement old pension scheme is another big issue old pension scheme new pension scheme then your your culinary distinct will also come into question and all that why it is so important in the life of a common Bengali family that kind of questions monument I think it is in BBD Bagh if somebody has any idea of always monument of Geography definition Delhi is experiencing this question and then about Glacier you said in Sikkim is a game of glacier in Sikkim name of Geography community and all that is a very important is the Prime Minister you are a good candidate very good candidate communication skill is very good opinions by large have been balanced maintain that and personal honesty is very important because we are going to be a future bureaucrat while asking questions board will also try to see whether you have purchase personal integrity or not honesty of personal integrity honesty of purpose while answering questions are very important communication I told you balance views I told you and whenever you can give some innovative idea believe in yourself go with a positive body language take care of yourself and don't forget that how to enter and didn't even think I don't even realise I was doing that I think when I watch the video I will notice that is the purpose whole purpose when you go for the real actual interview if you have any questions to ask which question do you think I answered well all questions you answer well but there is always go for improvement if you get the intent of the question like the very first question about unemployment linking to the government plans the next question on the Panchayati Raj institution why there is a climber to have a control over Panchayati Raj system is all indicative of the basically depending on the government that is the battle which is going on there things in a perspective but if you can make it more incisive isn't it that is whole purpose in other questions also I think your cold wave and this is not that I could not answer more specific nothing nothing serious another question that I wanted to ask was what about the length of my answers was it too long it was ok good for you to give a brief yes thank you so much thank you sir
