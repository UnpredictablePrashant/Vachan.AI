can you cut the cost in the Healthcare sector head of Sharda act do you support this you know reservation or you are against this Kolkata surrounding can you tell us the difference between these two textile industries so is it a good news for Japan good afternoon good afternoon thank you sir please introduce yourself to support from Solapur District in Maharashtra I have done my schooling in Marathi medium from my hometown thereafter I pursue my MBBS GS Medical College it's a Government Medical College in Mumbai after doing one year of an internship I started to prepare for UPSC for my hobbies include dancing and reading books and movies and watching fiction movies I also like to play tennis so what are you doing you are preparing for the Civil Services yes ok tell me should I call you Sudeep for Tejas say my name is tell me you are basically a doctor MBBS also and you see in our country there is a death of a good doctor why did you want to pursue career as a doctor to serve the humanity I did want to pursue as a doctor and that is why I started my MBBS but the thought of becoming a Civil Servant had been planted in my childhood days by my grandfather he was a professor and he had groom some some of his students so you always encourage me I should do this and when I started to work in the government set up sir I realise that as a doctor they were obviously very good things that we were doing limitations of scale and I understood as I my visions as my horizons expanded that a Civil Servant can do the good at a much larger scale with the authority and with the banking that he gets tell me what is your vision of India from 10 years from now and your role in that reason India as becoming if not the complete Bharat or the super power and at least a predominant regional power in both political and economic sense and my role as young Indian I would like to be in the government and be a Civil Servant working in best possible capacity that the various welcome welfare schemes of the government are reaching To The Last Man Standing and if that Endeavour is not planned out I will certainly have the benefit of my medical graduation sir ok tell me about Ayushman Bharat scheme isn't it what are your views on the insurance model which is there in a part of Ayushman Bharat scheme and changes in the morning is predominantly adopted from the United States however there are certain other models like Universal Healthcare system which dominantly focuses on the preventive aspect rather than the security aspect and the insurance having if balance is to be achieved Ayushman Bharat is a very good scheme the only problem with the Ayushman Bharat not the only problem with the chief problem is problem of missing middle that is it covers the lower one third of the Indian population and the wealthy once you have the cover of private insurance but the middle population is currently not covered to perhaps the aim of the government it is said that it will become in future Ayushman Bharat 2.2 which will be a Universal Health Care scheme could be a good could be a good thing the second would be that there are certain deficiencies in the operation of the scheme even it is designed in a good way like there was a case in which patient was kind of robbed of his funds Safdarjung Hospital which is a government hospital in Delhi so that would be 2nd coverage of elements and diseases covered under this scheme eventually the country should move towards Universal health part of the health transfer to a very expensive proposition for the patients of our country and which we can I refer to even where the cost can you cut the cost in the Healthcare sector what are the areas where you can think that cost can be cut first thing which comes to my mind is focusing more on the preventive Healthcare like prevention is better than cure it is often said the disease like suppose tuberculosis if it is advanced the patient has to and if it is advance in the in the terms of MDR TV or HDR TV the patient has to go through not just the physical also the financial pain but if we work on the preventive aspect of tuberculosis on a community level perhaps the patient will not have to go through that in the first place to preventive aspect would be first and second would be sir if we increase the insurance coverage to a Universal level and there is an increase in the health seeking behaviour of the community then the people will be incentivised to reach the Healthcare at an earlier stage which is often not seen in Indian community today there is a tendency to delay the visit to the Healthcare facilities because of both the financial burden and simply lack of awareness last question from my side what do you mean by resilient Healthcare and how it is different from the promotive Healthcare sir I understand resilient Healthcare as the Healthcare system which can cope with the new challenges which are faced by it for example the Black Swan event like covid-19 was not anticipated by anyone but more or less even though India health care system had major it did with it in a commendable way considering our resources so that would be a resilient health care system promote your health care system I think there is a broader concept very work on both the preventive aspect of the Healthcare the security aspect the basically all the dimensions of the Healthcare sir so that is what I understand thank you thank you very much thank you Sardar act 1929 sorry it was passed by on the recommendations of Mr Har Gobind Dasha if I'm not mistaken and it was regarding child marriage to increase the age of marriage for boys to 16 and for girls to 14 I'm not exactly sure about this but it was regarding the existing messages to increase that there are two Trends regarding it as an honorable Prime Minister said the age of both the success should be raised to 21 the benefit is that especially the adolescent age will get to complete their higher education which will equip them to enter into the workforce and get a more paying or more qualified job but the downside is that even the current age limits are at places not being enforced very well and it leads to sometimes harassment of some communities because in their traditional sense the marriage is permitted for example Muslim personal law marriage is allowed once a girl reaches puberty so there is some legal Ton in that regard so either it should be reduced and made same for both the boys and girls to 18 years or 21 years either way looks good to me sir a doctor was the ancient Greek doctor photo say of those kinds of those times who invented the hypocritical did not invent I believe the doctor in the traditional sense as we understand was not the doctor of those times but he was more of a philosopher and knowledgeable person of all sorts of discipline sir all disciplines of knowledge and what is the difference between natural and social was the Indian he was the father of Indian Medicine and heroes charak Samhita deals more with the diseases the Ayurvedic Herbs to deal with them and social was the father of Indian surgery so he wrote about various surgical elements and how to do and how to how do I know plastic chemical name to use for blood transfusion etc medicine and no not you Tejas basically the Sanskrit origin name which means bright fighter indigenous light combat aircraft Tejas has been the do you have any idea about its capability yes sir currently I think there are two students in Indian Air Force and the current Tejas mark 1 which is in use it has around 500 km of a range and it also carried some missiles it is the lightest in its category in the world and that is the unique selling point of IT in fact India is in talks with South Station country like Philippines Indonesian further while using with the use of this General Electric 414 engines so it will improve the capacity of in the dog fights and various surveillance and many words how does this climate change climatic change affect our health set climate change affects our health in multiple ways and it is really mind boiling to understand it in all the dimensions first for example sir some diseases which were not prevalent are getting more common in some areas for example dengue know the dengue mosquito the ad is mosquito has been found to survive longer in the increase temperatures so previously those areas which were not having dengue will have more of it while at the same time some diseases like Malaria the Anopheles Mosquito which is the carrier of carrier of it will not be able to survive the temperature is going to be changed in the food composition as and it will have some impact upon the nutrition of the people and again it will impact the immunity and resilience of the people to face diseases so that would be one thing again and interesting phenomenon has has been occurring there has been melting of ice glaciers and ice caps so some of those diseases which were previously not at all common are now being discovered and those diseases which were not heard of in last 5700 years have been reported in those countries where they have been practically wipe out like some European countries etc so these strange kind of things are thank you thank you were selected for IR MS in civil service examination 2022 write in this application also you have applied for irms as reference number 8 preference in the same fashion as the add kept last years from Maharashtra right Maharashtra has recently passed a law giving you know 10% reservation to Maratha community where you stand on this issue I mean do you support this you know reservation or you are against this if yes if you are against this on what grounds I think the problem of according reservation to the dominant section is that it creates more and more demand from other sections as well and predominantly the root cause of this demand which has been present across the Maratha community is economic and reservation actually does not satisfy the root cause of the demands because they are not enough jobs in the government sector where the reservation is applicable so even though so what should be done I mean in order to dispense with the entire concept of reservation what should be the alternative mechanism to replace that system generation of more jobs for the youth which is coming out in the labour market and for that overall we have to increase the economic power of the state and the nation both and set the various steps that are being taken for that manufacturing boost to manufacturing my production link incentive schemes and killing of a youth improving upon the higher education so this broad steps need to be taken sir and visit the specific demand we have to convince and show honest conversation with the leaders of Maratha community that even though it is not visible in the near future that immediate fruits will be low hanging fruits are there but this is the only way to go ahead with it's also a doctor by profession right can you please tell me there is one very important act known as pcpndt act of 1994 so just tell me has this backbone in effective actually I mean the the purpose for which this was introduced we have not been able to know check that it was primarily for the purpose of checking no incidents of female you know poetic site still we have not been able to often on we come across multiple you know instances of such nature can you please tell me what modification should be you know done in this act so as to make it more stringent so as to prevent any incident in a coming to the phone I believe that the act has only for the matter not just pcpndt act can become only so much effective as to the society truly accepted and in fact in my opinion pcpndt act is pretty stringent there are some loopholes but these are because of the in effective implementation on ground of the Excel for example sir from my personal experience often those inspectors who come across are not very e in their dealings and which gives the doctors who are also not ethical some leave a to practice this kind of unethical practices which is not just bad for that particular individual it to get gives a bad name to the whole profession so you are suggesting the act as sufficient in a provisions to buy but yes we need to be no ethically and morally upright the society in general has to convince his practices for example in sir in Beed district there was a famous case in which particular doctor was committing female foeticide for almost 10 years and almost everyone knew about it but it took 10 years for this case to be resolved and the doctor to be put behind the bars so this should not my last question to you as a doctor I mean you know you must have seen in the recent past as well and many many acts of vandalism may not take place in hospital premises whenever you know any patient unfortunately notice at the end of any doctor so what are what are the What are the laws can you name a few laws which give you a prote to a doctors in such scenarios and proposal of bringing about a specific act for this purpose protecting the Healthcare setup but it was not accepted by the health Ministry of Home Affairs so it was put down but during the case of pandemic I think the epidemic diseases Act was amended to give the protection to Healthcare setups very different government do you think doctor should go on strike because they are into a very essential services as justify that there are no pitching for their eyes to be implemented but do you think more it is correct your keeping the lives of many people at stake Attar and proceeding for strike sir I think it should be only the last resort and even in that case the essential Healthcare emergency Healthcare critical Healthcare should not allowed to get disturb because that is simply allowing the patients or those who can be easily saved or our reasonable chance to be saved to die and that is against the hypocritical so that is not acceptable but beyond that there should be a gradual processor first negotiations and if it does not work out I got it thank you are from Solapur right place known for its textile industry second half of 19th century there were two major hubs of these textile industry one was the western part of India Maharashtra Gujarat other was the Eastern part of India Kolkata and surrounding can you tell us the difference between these two textile industries part of the country it was due to predominant good in India the difference in terms of ownership off this structure of this factory in my hometown I am aware that there were actually privately owned right and perhaps that was not the case in the Eastern Part I will have to look up on look after it while you are a doctor recently launched has published an article related to the to India facing double value at one end there is malnutrition at other end there is obesity which is increasing like anything can you tell us how big the problem of obesity is malnutrition encompasses both the ends of the spectrum undernutrition and overnutrition and we often tend to relate malnutrition with the undernutrition part because that has been the case in India for such a long time except in the last two or three decades the problem of obesity has skyrocket I do not have the exact I do call the exact data Sir but the overall assessment was that not just in the elderly even in the youngsters of today and of all age groups from toddlers to adolescence to young people the problem of obesity has been rising why it is increasing can you give us two or three years it is because of the so called Genetics or the sedentary Lifestyle these are all the factors which are responsible but as I understand medicine the most important change has been in a diet of the processed foods Ultra processed food earlier it was simply not available when our parents were of arrays because of the economy not getting liberalized in the last three decades it has been easily available and also the exposure has started right from the birth of the child so that is why all the non communicable diseases which are really earlier found in the 15th of 60s are getting 20 and 30 because effectively the period for which we are exposed to them has been the same if the person starts to consuming this kind of thing in the in his studies then by the 50 is the exposure is the same as if he starts from his birth up to him up to his 20s so that is the chief finance can you tell us the concept of hidden hunger yes sir refers to the deprivation of micronutrients like minerals minerals vitamins etc in the diet leading to lot of deficiency disorders as against to the deprivation of calories which leads to hunger as Indian Indian population are we are basically food security but we are not nutritionally secure so can you tell us about the economy of medical tourism for India and what is its economic potential for us sir I am not able to recover by the end of this decade where we are aiming to go around 400 billion by the by 2030 and currently it is one of the booming sectors to say Sunrise sector in the tourism industry because India has some office advantages in that regard sir Indian doctors are usually well trained especially in the those who come from the government set up and have had to go through the growing training then they are well spoken in English which is the advantage by dealing with the foreign patients the private sector Hospital some of them are almost as luxurious as the five star hotels which the patients The Tourist medical tourism and all of this is available to them at a fraction of cost at what is available in their home countries say United States or even other European countries by last question is two or three ethical considerations that you place forward if you are going through any kind of Medical Research compliance first would be compliance with the legal requirements for example taking the permission from ethics committee of the that particular Institute second would be full and informed consent informed means full disclosure of all the possible risk to the patient the third would be compensating the patient for any unfortunate loss or if there is a loss of life then to the family of the patient and if there is some kind of positive Discovery then the benefits of the discovery should also come to the participants of that study free of cost that should be the bare minimum of it and that if there is a clear indication that the study is not going well then there should be from termination of its effects some times medicine graduate can you tell us what what is the full form of MBBS sorry it is Bachelor of medicine and bachelor of surgery if you use the first letters of this expansion it will become bmbs yes sir actually intrigued me back when I started to read about it it has its origin in history goes from a Latin phrase some medicine and surgery recently there are talks that more number of people above the age of 100 are blowing their birthday candles in Japan so is it a good news for Japan definitely it is a good news in the sense that they have continually have been continually expanding their average and elderly population is not just aging it is aging well it's a good sign but it is also problem of drinking population is not good sir can you this with the economy of Japan Japan has recently slipped into recession yes sir and it has also reduced in the terms of GDP to fourth place from third place and that has been called some time as the Lost decade or lost generations lost generation of the Japan since practically its economy has not grown in the last two decades it has a direct correlation with the working age population of the Japan it has been shrinking for some time and the Japanese society being an inverted looking society and isolated particular age group that we referred to as working age population in India it is 15 to 69 I'm not wrong do you think that all sorts of treatments that are available that often claim that they are capable of reversing the aging process question number 1 is it possible to reverse the aging process question number 2 is it ethical to do that it is very much possible to reduce the biological age obviously the chronological age cannot be reduced but the biological age can be reduced by simply accepting and implementing honestly the Healthcare advice that we most of us know and the simple habits like eating healthy eating sleeping at time sleeping well and there are there are also some chemical which claim to do that I am not aware of their efficacy Sir but it's growing field answer regarding the ethicality of it I think it should be perfectly ethical for a person to adopt these healthy images and improve his healthy lifespan going beyond that there is going to be a problem of population is every person goes through this but I think sir it always gets balance because as the society advances the total fertility rate and the growth of population reduces as we have seen the trend across the world final set of questions to you can you recall the names of some women participants that were very prominent and active during India's freedom struggle just two to three names and their prominent contribution the first name which comes to my mind is Sarojini Naidu she was a head of Gandhi and Gandhiji and also the Governor of Uttar Pradesh Independence then Kasturba Gandhi also the wife of Kamla Nehru wife of when is your interview 8th of April which attribute is this second interview in 4th attempt 730 second review last interview was in 19 you said 2022 fundamental question when I asked you to introduce yourself why did you not mention about yourself in the waste by design or it slip to my mind I think I should have put it in the middle complexion of joined it and it has not been a major thing on my mind to become a part of the civil services you are already there today responding to become member of Indian Administrative Service police service important achievement which you should have mentioned yes sir make sure that because we are aware of this and have already been selected in The RMS but we wanted you to speak which is why we did not ask you from our site so when you go for the interview make sure that you clearly tell about your achievement also afraid of getting questions prepare a brief a lot of time is there brief on the Railways also first match of according to what was into this service which are based on which recommendation do you think entry in The RMS through civil services is a good idea Railway being purely a technical service why why we are recruiting people only through the civil services are there used to be through Engineering services and civil services and committee recommendation was also to create to separate selection process and reason try to give very balance please based on that information only so that the board is aware of the fact that you have gone on ul and and you don't have a single day working experience in the railway issues of railway accidents Railway reforms and all that to prepare a brief on railway accident railway reforms are some changes which has happened in the railway like merger of Railway budget what was the reason for that and all that help the Railways or it has not help the railway that kind of thing then your name is Tejas Express is also there Express is different from Vande Bharat what is Navbharat train and all that the design aspect and operational aspect of about the Tejas Rajdhani and all that these are all your friends it has been an important and all that what are the some basic design features you should be aware and also what is the speed of a semi high speed train what is the speed of a high speed train you are coming from Bombay so high speed corridor is getting constructed between BKC Mumbai Kurla Complex to your Gujarat so what is the what are the broad features of your High Speed Rail corridor what is the speed which country is giving us loan what are the terms and conditions of that loan coming from Japan only half an hour to understand you are a doctor try to cover a lot of areas Nexus between big pharmaceutical companies doctors good or bad practices in the corporate hospitals and all that reflected you know the issues how to address those concerns and the Healthcare issues in the rural India also were Synergy between the two and then your traditional Medicine System and your own system how are you going to integrate those two systems and all that general questions and medical healthcare issues back in focus after this covid so what changes do you think in the Healthcare system and all that mental health changes have been incorporated in the Healthcare act Mental Health Care act also you should see the important provisions are there are not going to details speaking about the contributions of women you spoke a few names that's very good but I wanted you to speak name of Savitribai Phule also who happens to him from Maharashtra to forgotten that wherever such questions are asked try to think of Maharashtra ok you farmers issue is again a major issue in Maharashtra to read about that do you think that farmers are still committing suicide if yes why they are committing suicide why farmers of Maharashtra not a part of education with the MSP should be legalized what are the issues involved in that those general questions regarding farmers that is one segment which you have to prepare political segment your recent last one or two years have seen that direction is taking place in the political parties Supreme Court judgement on that speakers views on do you think that speaker has gone by the spirit of the Supreme Court judgement on his evolved his own style on theory to old is to give is audit what he gave to those general questions about that and that again take to the broader issue of how speaker in your opinion should be a non partition person is it feasible is it possible that kind of 187 have already secured nothing much to set your camera 200 I can tell you absolutely no problem just read these are probably will be getting something from that and only thing which you will start if you have any specific question to ask the voice everything you are very nice to talk to you when we so it is very animated discussion on issues that is what is required of a Civil Servant and you are very good in that your communication skill is also excellent energy level is good for total disposition total personality is very good no problems anyway no problem
