tell me do you think the growing trend of judicial officers being appointed to Parliament after retirement undermine the Judiciary do you think that pursuing law in powers of women to a great extent than any other field of education in our country as a political thinker what is contribution of Aurobindo Ghosh to relocate and rehabilitate the people who are being affected do you think that the time has now come that we should include health has one of the grounds for imposition of emergency in our country may I come and search good evening good evening thank you sir please give a brief introduction about yourself so my name is Diya Dasgupta I am a lawyer by training I completed my ba LLB from National Law University Odisha in 2018 from 2019 I started working as a legal research consultant with the centre for child in law situated in Bangalore and simultaneously continued my preparation just this year in the month of August I completed my Masters LLM in dispute resolution post graduation you are already working in the field of love to join civil services my primary motivation of joining the civil services started in the my Law schools are there was a severe water crisis situation in our hostel and the girls of the girls hostel had to go to the boys hostel fetch water and climb up to the fourth floor there was no lift I started Googling situations of water crisis in Odisha because my hostel was situated there and the district the then District Magistrate of the Mayurbhanj district through his Engineering at facilitated free flow of water in a village which did not even have electricity connections so that was a big drive within me to motivate me to pursue the civil services also sir I wanted to interview at a stage before the wrong had already been committed as a lawyer I would get to fight my client's case after the right or wrong has been validated so these two are there is going to have the government in formulating policies so first because I am trained in law I know where Pacific scheme might face the test of constitutional validity or invalidity that is an area where I'll be able to put in my inputs secondly as a law is principally involved in every stage of our life during policy formulation something that I am associated with right now or beat execution part of it answer third I think I would bring to the table a very wide perspective because in law school we were made to study 60 law subjects touching up on everything in a little bit of a way so I think that would be a diversified I would come with you that is going to help you in taking distance knowledge is also dangerous that time what do you say not withstanding the fact that too much knowledge can be dangerous at times but being able to take an informed decision from me having thorough knowledge about the criminal laws and the constitution constitution of India I think that would prompt quick decisions the growing trend of judicial officers being appointed to Parliament after retirement undermine the Judiciary itself to an extent if the appointment is immediate after the retirement that could raise a question so I feel that after retirement that could be cooling off period for the judge concern and there is no law which prohibit such appointment so maybe after the cooling of period they could definitely take part in the law making aspect of the country two have such a long procedure to approach justice in our country it's very true that does happen and that is why perhaps laws like the constitution of India have been described as a lawyers Paradise despite article 39a talking about access to justice to the vulnerable sections there are lack of Legal Aid clinics at the grassroot level when a woman's right is violated say inside her home under domestic violence lack of awareness is the second reason why she would not know what's the next step unless someone does her hand holding answer third is the huge pendency of cases the tarikh pe tarikh tagline is so in trains in the hearts of every Indian even very rich Indian would think twice to approach the courts so that is the reason IPC CrPC and Evidence Act have been replaced by a new set of law of IPC has been renamed as the Bharati and as Andhera the second the CrPC has been renamed as the Bhartiya Nagrik Suraksha Sanhita and the last one is the Bhartiya Saksham Sanhita which is the evidence act what is the scale of reforms that these new laws have occurred in what is the scale of reforms that these new laws have occurred in brought in sir I feel that the scale is quite a bit for instance number one under the bnss the second chapter 5 has been included which talks about offences against children and women of a sexual nature those have extended the Ambit of protection for children specifically under the age of 18 recognising marital rape talking about aging increasing the age limit for gang rape of girls from 16 to 18 and so these in toto have a greater Ambit of protection for women second they have done away with certain laws which were there in the IPC but they had become the function like section 109 of the IPC talks about attempt to suicide despite the mental health act of 2017 saying that attempt to suicide is no longer a crime it was still present so it has done away with those different laws and third sir they were still references to the architect laws and reference to Emperor because it was drafted in 1860 IPC and by Lord Mercury and references have also been holiday so this law I think is in Spirit Of The 21st Century India server you must have heard about the schools of law by the Honorable Supreme Court recently one of the judgements which talks about how women have equal right of inheritance to the father's property but details I am not very aware of the recent judgement sir if there has been any What are the differences between these two schools of law I have to brush it up I have a sketchy reference but I do not want to take a guess I would be able to clearly demarket the differences tell me one more thing that you actually had pursued law do you think that pursuing law in powers of women to a great extent than any other field of education in a country when I am aware of the law I know when I am someone is taking advantage of me and I know that legally I have a records because I'll be qualified to pursue my own case and secondly Sir after 5 years of cool the employment opportunities are excellent and very diverse so even economically I would be very stable sovereign I would feel like a confident adult good very good tell me at least two limitations of pocso act the first limitation of pocso is lack of recognition of consensual sexual activities for adolescence because of which increasing number of adolescent male children are coming before the Juvenile justice at these days and seconds the cases are not yet being heard on a very fast track manner as was the expectation with which pocso was ruled out and the Fast Track courts were established answer if I mean there is a third limitation in the Juvenile justice board according to the pocso act there have to be three people sir one is the district the magistrate the second would be a specialist who will be a psychologist the supposed to be a third person but from my experience of having appeared before the Juvenile justice board often there are just two people who are taking the decisions so this third person is also missing sir is there any chances of also filing some fake cases that is one of the major lacked only under the pocso act but in other sections like section 498A even under Rs 36 cases is one pressing concern of the DGP of any particular state and some allegation corruptions have been charged against you and honorable High Court actually has given the verdict to step down immediately from the post would you step down immediately would you be fine looking for some legal options to challenge High Court so I would not immediately step down I would file at least some form of an interlocutory application for the stay order of the high court and in the meantime either appeal to a larger bench of the same High Court or put an appeal before The Central Administrative Tribunal or I would perhaps even take the records to the supreme court because if I know that I am not guilty then even admission of guilt would tend the office that I hold and paint my personal reputation also so I'll fight the case till the last limit have you heard about the Honorable Supreme Court has given certain guidelines to the state government regarding the appointment of a DGP and department of the highest officers what is this guidelines for the appointment of do not recall all of them but some guidelines that I can recall work that the highest officer should not be transferred before exhaustion of a period of I think two years or security of tenure so that he can successfully carry out his activities rather than that at this moment I can't recall thank you you are from North 24 Pargana right so North 24 Pargana India's first war of independence what I am talking about what is the common connection between the two Mangal Pandey the first Bullet was fired at 5 Rishi Aurobindo Sarani Rishi Aurobindo Ghosh political thinker what is contribution of Aurobindo Ghosh for his beef duration of a politician for 4 years he was a politician for 4 years he was considered to be an extremist and one of the best things which I feel he had said is integration is the law of nature and he talked about how he talked about the concept of spiritual nationalism and how the nationalism transcends the geographical boundaries of a country like India and how India deserves to be free from the clutches of the colonial rulers so that it can inspire The Other what is the key Idea behind this term spiritual nationalism how this is different from the modern versions of nationalism nationalism embodies the concept that nation has a spirit of its own and that spirit is not limited to just its people for the people who are the decision makers or even the geographical frontiers it trans all these tangible limitations if I may put it like that and it has the capacity of achieving Global committee that was one of his dreams are having no form of slavery or colonialism Amrita Sen right he has given some contribution to the theory of justice right justice is one of the pillars of study of political science what is contribution of Amartya Sen in the theory of justice remember from my reading he talked about Social justice and he also mentioned how building upon roles in principles of Justice he said that focus has to be there on the three principles of roles in justice especially on the differentiated approach how in the form of affirmative action that we have in our country today that justice will only be seen to be done if those who need a further push they should also be taken care of in strengthening relation of India with Bangladesh what will be the role of the concept of Vishva Bangla Vishva Bangla tagline which has become very popular in West Bengal right now and I think it will push for the concept of para diplomacy which we studied in Political Science and some boring that concepts are because there are a lot of issues which West Bengal needs to sort out with Bangladesh right from the Teesta water sharing to the issues of illegal immigration and even extending help developmental help in assistance of South I think it will further the bilateral relations tremendously question to you you write food blogs right yes sir are you have some kind of interesting food box what makes Kolkata biryani so special I mean why the people from Kolkata they keep on fighting with other parts of India for proving Supremacy of their Biryani it is right now please explain Kolkata biryani comes with this big piece of potato we call it the aloo and that piece of potato has in the best of places of biryani from Kolkata the piece of potato has flavour in few still the centre most core that is how is boiled it's not the boiling level of that potato is extremely good that is one of the differentiating features second it comes with a piece of egg and whatever yes sir and whatever non veg and then you have the rice the third point of differentiation flavour of the writer it's it has a very subtle flavour which is not very overpowering and it's not very spicy at the same time so its flavour infused without being spicy overall these are the three years West Bengal that's on the east coast of India one why is that part of India is experiencing a lot of cyclones increasing intensity as well as frequency that is suddenly lower level cycle becomes extreme and two because of the impact on mangrove that we are seeing how is it impacting the local community become very frequent in the eastern coast is because of climate change because of global warming the sea surface temperature of the Bay of Bengal is increasing and it is comparatively higher than the Arabian Sea because of that the frequency cyclones have increased and the intensity with which the land falls are happening that has also gone up because of states like Bengal and Orissa and their proximity they are the most approximate in receiving the backlash of such cyclones in Sundarbans ma'am specifically when there are a lot of Hotel Resorts etc which Bose the local employment prospects they have added to the crz norms also but every time that kind of a cyclone happens there are floods and flooding takes away the housing prospects some of them are not pakka houses so the housing prospects their food security aspect and the daily employment levels get destroyed even the hotels that are there they often see flooding from the coast and the damage is a lot of problems yes mam because of this sequence cyclones there two ways the land is getting degraded and if I may mam the agricultural land is also getting degraded because of the kind of cloudburst Reigns which have been as a result of cyclones and also because of this sudden salinity immigration because the sea water is coming in and that hampers the productivity of agricultural land any steps by government to relocate and rehabilitate the people who are being affected is there any particular policy or just a major response whenever the cyclone happens any specific policy that has been ruled out by the government of Bengal other than the overall disaster mitigation programs which is happening initially the approach was to just respond disasters like cyclones happen but now and Odisha are neighbour is a good Pioneer in that regard so there are Highlands created where quick relocation of people can be there there are also greater barricades in the form of mangroves which are now being protected initially there were some encroachment upon mangroves which could be neglected or which was not that strictly protected so these are the mitigation measures that they are taking even before a disaster happens you will be the best person to US time that we are saying that on one hand the women in India are being empowered years of being a good example is increasing by the day it shows in the ncrb data as contrast to the Global gender index where we are improving why is this tool extremes happening side by side mam whenever economic empowerment of women takes place it is a change from status code whenever there is a change in status code couple of things happen number one more number of women are going out to work there are night shifts for women that is taking place and when their women are economically empowered they would want to express their empowerment in freedom in different other ways and that in different ways right from The Grass root level faces a systematic retaliation I feel this resistance to this change in the form of predominant patriarchy a lot of men feel that dominating women is not just a way of stopping them but it is a way of expressing their power so rape have not just been defined as a violins it has also portrayed as an as as a portrayal of power of one gender Over The Other gender I think this is the reason why on hands economic empowerment also but then there is retaliation towards the empowerment because there is changed from status can be safely say that more women get empire and more crimes would increase in a society so we should may be stopped women empowerment the statistics is indicating towards that but I don't think it would be fair to draw a blanket conclusion that women empowerment is directly proportional to crimes against women because as Gandhiji had said that when a woman is empowered she has the greatest authority to ensure that the subsequent generations have a Holistic form of empowerment so I think when a boy child is told that it's fair to cry or when a boy child is told how he supposed to respect his sister and also do the household shows a Holistic systematic Reform can take place thank you thank you can you tell me when is national voters day celebrated the entire world witnessed a major crisis during the covid-19 pandemic period a lot of issues were faced by the countries at international level and as well as the domestic level do you think that the time has now come that we should include health has one of the grounds for imposition of emergency in our country emergency should be held oriented and not be exploited under the gap of being a political emergency my next question to you is on one hand are constitution talks about the fundamental right to equality and on the other hand we have certain discriminatory provisions related to reservation how do you analyse this dichotomy article 14 of the Indian Constitution yes it talks about equality but it talks about equality to a group of people who are situated in a equal position that is the Genesis of the evolution of the jurisprudence of affirmative action that if there are people who belong to a class who are discriminated against they can get a push in order to get better opportunity of a better standard of living so how is equality different from the concept of equity talks about how people should be treated in an equal manner where is equity talks about their specific requirements for specific groups and that should be given to them if I may give an example yes please equality would mean In A Metro commute travelling in the Delhi Metro that there should be no coach reservation for women but equity takes cognizance of certain physical differences and certain social economic factors which hence results in a reserve compartment for women in the metro route recently the women reservation bill was passed by the Parliament what impact do you think this step will have on the functioning of legislatures in our country so I feel that it is one of the most progressive steps that have taken place in the past few months a because there will be more number of people who will be more number of women who will come up and contest elections and second it would also warrant a Reform within the hierarchical or the democratic structure of political parties also where the political parties themselves now take it upon themselves to take up a lot of women representation ok according to you what are the three pressing areas which will post a challenge in the upcoming decade for India in terms of environment the number one I think is climate finance weaving country of the Global south and architect recently in cop 28 said that 500 billion has to be allotted to developing countries for their climate mitigation measures so the second is the proximity of disasters making a 16 year climate vulnerable India has been declared to be one of the top most countries which are extremely vulnerable given a proximity to the sea levels answer third is with respect to transition from A majorly carbon carbon petroleum based economy to Green my next question to you is currently we are witnessing an increasing number and an exponential growth in the credit lending platforms the webpage platforms and application based platforms what impact do you think that this phenomena will have on the liquidity scenario in our country overall experience in this area is a little limited but what I can recollect from my readings is if these platforms are doing out more number of loans and that's also taking place without any KYC norms for Assurance of being able to payback that amount at the moment may be there could be even a rise of cost price is because of purchasing power they could be inflation cost push in demand push inflation could take place but then there will be a very high rate of NPS sub when there is an inability to repeat repeat those loans back ok they are my final question to you is according to you how justified are the interventions within the domestic affairs of a country by other countries or International Agencies side do not feel their justified especially when that intervention impinges upon the sovereignty and the national interest of the country concerned then how do you analyse the 1971 intervention of India in the then East Pakistan number one are national interest was threatened at that time because of the military incursions from west Pakistan and also that increasing on slot of illegal immigrants coming into Bengal and Assam from east Pakistan and secondly the measures which were taken were also pursued after careful deliberation with the opposition party in Bangladesh itself and there was Mukti Bahini which was trained by India from within so it was not that India had deliberately tried to put forth a colonial if I may intervention step but it was strengthening the support system from within who Rose to their Independence dispute is between Bengal because the river is about water sharing dispute between the state of West Bengal and the country of Bangladesh called it does not really talk about very equitable distribution of rivers and that is why the contention still exists from 24 Parganas gangas also there famous Gangasagar episode why it is popularly said that south east Bar Bar Gangasagar Ek Bar why it is so sweet is this interview yes I think the number one who is the covid-19 pandemic and I had not had any live mocks Experience so my interview was on the second day so I had to just go without I think body language and all of that does play a crucial role and second itself philosophical live but I think I was too obsessed with the outcome which had a negative bearing on my performance I have not found that you have to be very natural and normal person interview is a pressure on your mind but that pressure should remain within you should appear on your face I can understand to be happy and enjoying the interview positive so you when you enter enter smartly make an entry create Board members and their until you are asked to sit down take your seat and then the chairman will make you feel very comfortable I must have notice covid year was very difficult year for everybody so let us take it as an aberration because you are capable of scoring very high marks in the interview baby 185 190 2008 if you are getting marks in that range short period whatever questions we ask you variety of issues with answers were quite balance so your personal integrity your integrity of purpose let there be no compromise on that if you don't know anything doesn't matter but speak when you know number one number two focus no you are one girl who has studied law who is the working in organisation dealing with child labour and all that we didn't ask you questions related to that but may take you to that to prepare that area so what is the act per say what are the amendments in the act why law is in the country but implementation is lacking and all that such questions may be asked about the exploitation of child labour will take you to the area of NGOs working for the child welfare and all that so that will be one area second law related general issues 2023 is over what are the landmark judgements given by the supreme court whether you agree with the Supreme Court judgement on the same sex marriage or not marital rape sedition law judicial activism examples of judicial activism adventurism examples of judicial adventurous one or two examples behind the back of your mind so so that you are not found wanting there then Supreme court's rulings on 370 and all that appointment of Chief Election Commissioner you have to have make a view also what exactly is in your mind you know the Supreme Court decision and all that whether you agree with the Supreme Court verdict or not and why part is more important that you have to give very very balanced views and pointing judges collegium system and all that kind of questions delays in justice and all that and what are Good Works which have been of last 34 years which have been done by the supreme court translation is going on in a big way not only in Hindi but also in regional languages all translations issued on the portal or Supreme Court it comes with a Caveat that in case of any confusion read the original verdict why should situation with their and what are the reasons for that because all retired judges have been given this job of translating verdict in Hindi and regional languages that could be one area and then what reforms have been brought in by the supreme court in the area of justice delivery that is international affairs sky is the limit what questions will be asked for windows we try to touch Upon A few issues so read all the areas and suppose that which area in international relations really interesting that you can able to comprehensive reply on anything and everything related to that area that is the number one about the political science theories and all that now you are girl candidate of women candidate women empowerment policy is initiatives taken by the government including reservation and all that why it is called adhiniyam why should we worship and why should not be concept of equality for Nari do you think this word itself that kind of a question may be prepared to face such questions and rising out of that why it is linked with census delimitation what is delimitation and all that converts related to controversies about the state Central state relationship the areas of Central state relationship direct questions from build questions may be asked be prepared for that why growth is happening industrial growth is happening only in and around Calcutta why it is not happening on this Siliguri side or talk about corridors and all that what is chicken snacks and what is its importance and all that then you are staying in Bengaluru life in Bengaluru compare that life is life in Kolkata or also studied in Odisha development model of seven days time is there these are the general things which you should prepare and what questions are asked nobody can guarantee you that but if you are able to prepare this questions you are wonderful candidate by any stage of imagination you are not don't deserve to get 165 much more than what you got last year it has one of those of days and next time when you go you will be going with full confidence only thing is that your personal integrity you should not be compromised that is very important because the board will you selecting a future bureaucrat not is not a quiz competition kind of prepare all that and you will do well and have confidence in yourself and give balanced views episode
