president can you please tell me this doctrine of pleasure of the president is it independent right of the president I mean can it be exercised independent of any other advice does it come under discretionary a function of for the president as a student of Geography tell us one thing that is India having some kind of geographical advantage in becoming back office of the world please give a brief introduction about yourself in Lucknow but I have been raised in Delhi and thereafter I completed my schooling from Delhi and completed my graduation in engineering in Computer Science and then I was into website developing website design and development and then I qualify the UPPCS and currently I am serving as a state tax officer in the Government of Uttar Pradesh working there 2021 March 2020 you have passed out from Galgotia Institute talking about the private Engineering Colleges in our country why our private Engineering colleges are not part with the IIT there are couple of reasons first commercialisation of education is one thing and secondly the research environment the research environment is not at par with iits and third I think the iits are very less in number so if that number is increased and then private Institutions can also be at power with them future we have not received students coming out from the engineering colleges a large number of them either don't end up getting a proper employment or they settle with low wages why it is happening sir I think the problem the problem flows from the first thing only because the research environment is not that much and I think there is a missing there is a skill gap there is a skill gap between what the industry requires today and what are Institutions are offering so that is one thing second sir the kind of the technology industry in which direction it is going for example there is another is the trending news is it trending thing secondly sir I think the kind of incentives the kind of funding which is required between Academy and industry academia and industry connect that that is missing so they are not getting that much gainful employment tax office tell me how the transfer of funds from the centre to the states is decided department union government have you heard about the finance commission has been constructed the role of finance commission distributors funds to the state percentage for example the 15th finance commission allotted 41% to the states and it is the 41% is out of the divisible tax schools are not divided as such as going on in the country particularly coming from the southern states that the system of evolution of taxes to States is not equitable the states non performing so called bimaru States they end up getting much more larger share than they deserve at the cost of service state which are performing States what is your opinion on this I think it can be looked at into both ways firstly the southern States say that for example if we talk about Karnataka then it is getting only 25 paise for every rupee it is pending and Bihar is getting 7 rupees for one rupees it spending so sir because this is this is there is an inherent problem here that is the imbalance regional development is there so this is one thing so definitely if we have to look at the entire picture so the states have to be funded in that way but at the same time if we see the southern States then they are getting a fair share also and we have states like Maharashtra which is contributing well to the tax pool so it's not just a North South divide problem but it's like developed states are there and some states are underdeveloped so it is it is basically a large problem not just a North South problem ok ok coming to your up tax collection I think is going to zoom 40% to Rs 2.62 trillion by 24 24 Central time up what does it impact your status social economic landscape taxes are the fundamental of every scheme which is being run in for example they are the largest for example there was a recent study by RBI which talked of the state finances so GST and Taxes of they form the primary source of income for any state so those funds those revenues generated can be redirected to the schemes social welfare schemes and industrial impetus can be given in that way for example if we divide up into five regions then the central up can be promoted in the way of Greater industrialization based on capital intensive Industries so the revenue can be directed here in the Bundelkhand region Footloose Industries can be given a good role in the Purvanchal side in the Eastern UP their labour intensive Industries can be given so that we revenue can be directed and distributed so that there is overall a progressive output what is the meaning of your name is an Arabic word it means intelligent intelligent like in 2019 I do remember Shaheen Bagh was in news why it was it was a news because of the ntca protest so that was the main Centre where all the protested had gathered and that is why it wasn't news what happened to see whether it has been dropped the government has recently notified the rules that is going to be implemented implementation of this year regarding do you have any application implementation I think it is a very fair it is a clear law and government has cleared its intent very well and it has nothing to do with the kind of Miss information which is being spread so I think it will take a smooth turned Jaunpur is known as Siraj of East do you have any idea about this dynasty dynasty which ruler and a lot of poets were patronized there and everything the place had developed its own local culture so that is why it was it had that an analogy was drawn between the Shiraz which is a city in Iran to the city of Jaunpur airline reservation system what was that it was focused on decreasing the idea was already we have an airline reservation system but it was an attempt at reducing the loading time of which is there on the pages like we switch to switch web pages so the idea was to decrease the loading time and increase the efficiency so we took a database local database we created and that we developed on the language PHP you are also interested in artificial intelligence so artificial intelligence will also help in this reservation Airlines reservation all the reservation the cancellation can be automated without the need of any person as such so that is one thing secondly in the in cyber security in the cyber security because Airlines form a part of the critical infrastructure of the country and it is very important with respect to the security so we can have a predictive analysis tool inbuilt the built in the airline reservation system that can predict if there is any kind of Cyber attack on on the sensitive database of the system recently our probable Prime Minister was very much concerned with deep fake what is this defect is one of the great concerns which is today in the in India and all over the world also basically the mimics the videos and the text they may make the human like content so much so that it is thought to be true and that is of great concern one because it can be used by people non state actors to fuel rates and everything so these things are of great concern because they are fake what in the reality and this is to stop it or controlling it is usually dealt with it rules IT Act 2000 but as such the naming the particular name deep fake that is not there and we are also moving towards the deliberating on digital India Act so that will definitely include a Regulation and deep faith that was regarding his job in schools what is your opinion about this line with the supreme court ruling that it is it forms a since it forms a part of the non essential component of religion so it cannot be mandated and schools should have a proper uniform and that will bring in more equality and that will prevent any kind of discrimination so that is definitely in the interest of the community thank you thank you everyone World Bank and IMF for the first time are having officials of Indian Origin persons of Indian Origin together can you name them World bank is being headed by Ajay Banga and IMF women I am not able to recall at the moment I will definitely do remember any woman who is finance minister of any state of Finance Minister presented recently presented and the highlight of the Delhi Budget was the came up scheme for women wear in the women will be getting 1000 Rupees as an allowance if they are not being if they are not covered any in under any scheme as such so that was a woman was the main theme and they also showed that the budget is in surplus they have the budget is in surplus so social welfare schemes will be continued for example the Delhi Jal Board they will be the total size what is the total expenditure proposed what part of that is revenue expenditure what part is capital expenditure I don't remember the exact figure but it is something around 47000 crore that's total expenditure that the amount of the the government spends on Apex is emphasized or highlighted why it is important infrastructure if it is the infrastructure is a foundation of any economy and particularly a developing economy like India wherein if we have more roads more ease of it will translate into more ease of doing business it will translate that will translate into revenue generation in income generation and that will adjustment of geography how would you define an Equinox and height is different from solstice is basically when the days and nights are equal and solstice is when for example twice a year in March and in September when the days in June and December ok sir I just got confused with it happens in June when the day

Minister meeting which issues were discussed and what has been the fruitful outcome India it was not a very good primarily public stock holding and fisheries Divas saved of and but there was so these are the two main issues that is a public stock holding and fisheries there on the Government's list but the developed countries have been such an Alliance which kinds of is bringing the non trade issues into the into the discussions for labour is being discussed their and sustainability is being discussed there so for India it was not a good thing because our proposals have not been given a year and should we quit no sir quitting is not quitting will not be a good option but I think greater Alliance greater build up of consensus between other countries so that our proposal is accepted

functions throughout geographical boundary of Uttar Pradesh but there is only a single number and response comes from the nearby only how it is the algorithm is plant the Telecom operator the towers are divided in that way that whatever call is being made it will the data kids will be received at one particular Tower only I am not sure of it I am just making a gift about this I just wanted to know if you have any clue about this ok let's move to some other issues you know the election commission consists of three members including two election commissioners and one chief election commissioner to post a vacation now so the two members will be now appointment appointed can you please tell me how how the process is put into action for the appointment of election commissioners and

generally said that he holds office at the pleasure of the president can you please tell me this doctrine of pleasure of the president is it independent right of the president I mean can it be exercised independent of any other advice does it come under discretionary a function of the president pleasure of the president powers it is basically decided by the Council of Ministers and they advise the president the name of the Attorney General and the president appoints on the basis of that advice you know every policing system in our country is now in the diet need of you know going for certain kind of reforms and one of the dimensions of Reform is modernization of the police in the context of Uttar Pradesh can you please highlight some priorities priority areas of police modernization surface there are a couple of commissions which have come in this regard for example there was a Ribbon Commission there are there was a Padmanabha Commission they have suggested that modernization of Police Force can primarily be done when there is a when there is a check on the transfers and appointments that is one thing a body can be constituted in that way where in the transfers and appointments can only happen in a very transparent manner so one thing is there about police reforms I am more interested my my question is more focused on you know how the police can be made modern as per the expectation of the common mass is required more gender sensitivity sensitization and develop a connect with the people by interacting with them with like we can have awareness camps where they were the people can talk freely to them and they can be more sensitized towards the people from your deaf it seems that you got offer from Infosys and Cognizant but still you went ahead with some kind of freelance job as a web designer right why you not joined such prestigious company the primary Idea was sir I wanted to use my technical skills for social purposes so during my entire work profile as a freelancer also where I was able to contribute in any of the social problems I was able to address in any sense so these companies are purely technical and I wanted to because there was a broader purpose in my life to do something for the society and so I particularly it was a very conscious decision as a student of Geography tell us one thing that is India having some kind of geographical advantage in becoming back office of the world or India is so doing so well in it and all kind of services is there any special geographical advantage for India apart from other things location wise or demographic dividend we have the youth median age is 29 and we are having the largest workforce in the current apart from demographic dividend location wise our Positioning we have a very strategic position in the Indian Ocean region where in the trade is facilitated for example our closeness of approximately to malacca strait to the Arabian Sea to the gulf of anything to do with the time difference with the us and our major clients it can be thought in that period as a student of computer science tell us what is blockchain technology is distributed database ledger that contains information in the form of blocks and there is unique digital unique digital identifier of every block so there is Greater Record Keeping transparency and more security can be ensured because those blocks have a unique digital identifier and the information is stored by connecting them in the form of change so Record Keeping is there more authenticity is there so how this is used in modern days cryptocurrencies cryptocurrency is basically an application of blockchain and they are used for trading for for example if we talk about the Bitcoin the bit the prices of Bitcoin is rising so the if the total amount of that is traded for example a particular value is indexed to it so it can be traded like we do in the stock marketing prices of Bitcoin arising in recent primarily because of the greater allocation in the of the retail the allocation of the Bitcoins in the retail sector there is more retail participation secondly some Bitcoin having if event is coming up to the transactions for the rewards for the transactions are cut and therefore the prices of Bitcoins shoot so that is second thing and third is sir increased the spot Bitcoin ETF exchange traded funds as a government tax officer can you name top three districts of up in terms of state GDP so first is Ghaziabad Lucknow Varanasi these are the higher that you love Urdu poetry in context of Urdu poetry who is Akbar connection with Lucknow you are also connected with that Tamil Tamil when is your interview set 27th 27 and first interview experience required answers candidate is called before the board various states of the personality of girlfriend candidate is viewed by the board while asking questions to the way you answer questions various aspects of your personality will come out clear what is expected of you is to maintain high degree of personal integrity and honesty of purpose in all your answers your answers have to be very very balanced very clear and logical isn't it then you should have the ability to critically views and points of views and then your interest depth of interest depth of knowledge and your intellectual qualities these are basically things based on which you are a good candidate but at times what happened get into the area of gas work and that is what is very killing you don't know doesn't matter but speaking without knowing is very dangerous avoid anything which you don't avoid anything which you don't know why I am telling you IVF example on the child care leave TCL very important that should not be there 730 days ok good but initial one year that is 365 days it is 100% payment remaining it is 80% why I am telling you and this is available to male also not only restricted to female so this is probably wrong answer number one you give and on being pointed out by the board you contact him also known as this one answer will really impact your interview so our advice to you is wherever you are in a state of taught and all candidate the admit sir I don't know doesn't matter and not knowing and still speaking is very dangerous is only thing you have to avoid if you are able to avoid this then I think how the battle is one second thing is trying to understand intent of the question we asked a question on thursdays and then started explaining Equinox month wise to understand your thoughts for a second collect your thoughts for a second and then speak then your then you will understand your text officer Noida should have been the president of these two instances you could not correct that is what I am saying what questions will be asked nobody can tell you but you are already a member of the up administration service revolving around that particularly your tax collection your issues with because important tax evasion or tax evasion has been effectively and these two areas what steps have been taken by the state government tax evasion and plugging the otherwise linkages then you are collecting tax on behalf of the state government issues like GST baby that why certain items are outside have been kept outside the habit of GST and all that what are your personal views on that electricity or petroleum products are brought within the what is going to be implications of that you have to understand that will be asking you about the prevailing corruptions and all in the tax department and all that what is there what have you done in your personal capacity to ensure transparency in your working and the third thing is the kind of problem which of the faces at the work place any problem while working if yes then what are the problems if no then ok then you may be an exception but generally what women offers what type of problems then different laws what are guarantee is available to you what are the administrative mechanism to for the redressal of your advances and all that internal committee is an all those area you should be very hot but only suggestion from our side no conjecture if you are able to avoid that you will do all the best if you have any specific questions just like that in the cost member that that you that when you increase smart it should be smart the first impression is the last impression ok thank you
