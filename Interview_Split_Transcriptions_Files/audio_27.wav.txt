what is the relationship between the IB and raw what is megalith and what is sfio tell me the geopolitics of Andaman and Nicobar can you tell us geographical factors that affect the culture of a place good afternoon good afternoon please give a brief introduction about yourself my name is or Venkateswaran and coming from Kanyakumari district Tamil Nadu have completed my 10th standard and 12th standard from abroad Medical Science School Nagercoil Kanyakumari district later I have committed by bachelor's degree from Civil in civil engineering from RMK Engineering College in 2015 later I cleared GATE 2015 examination and opted for masters degree in hydrogen water resources engineering from Anna University Chennai since 2020 I have been serving in the Intelligence Bureau at Chennai my hobbies are pencil sketching and also watching internal security issues my father is a retired Handloom officer Government of Tamil Nadu and my mother is a homemaker how do you like working in the IV organisation and a very happy and proud to be a part of the organisation because it's a rare opportunity that anyone gets to works in a work in a intelligence organisation of integrity and also oldest intelligence organisation that was serving for the government for decades what is the relationship between the IB and the sister sister agency which was incorporated 1968 due to some deficiency in intelligence collection with respect to external security so in 1668 the raw was bifurcated from the Intelligence Bureau especially for external security of India sir why the agency of NIA was created sir due to some failures with respect to the countering terrorism in 2008 Mumbai attacks it was perceived that that should be an Central agency that was predominantly for combating the terrorism and also intelligence sharing due to this perspective the NIOS created to perform with respect to combating terrorism intelligence is one of the factor but apart from that there are operational and planning strategies so in order to integrate the Intelligence and operation predominantly for NIOS created IB primarily looks into your internal security and also counter intelligence works as a counter Intelligence Agency what is the distinct difference between the two internal security and intelligence sir the first mandate with internal security is to analyse the threat and also details such as Border Security coastal management terrorism and the other status of Indian security but with respect to counter in intelligence it means that you have to deter the sponge activities by the foreign Agencies be the any country across the border such a Chinese or Pakistan essay were included into India are through sleep agents and gather information from our government or any private Agencies to prevent the foreign Spice account intelligence is done what is that great refers to National intelligence script which is being monitor by the Intelligence Bureau at the centre and we used to co-ordinate and share input intelligence inputs with respect to various law enforcement agencies in the centre ok what do you mean by surgical strike sir strategic sorry surgical strike refers to the quick and fast damage inflicted across the nation against terrorist activity so the very little Collateral Damage is infected to ourselves where did India conducted for surgical strike sir I am not sure about the first surgical strike but recently like we have done surgical strike after the 2016 attacks ok and you tell me the concept of invasion also how invasion is different from the surgical strike Innovation and surgical strike what is the difference between surgical strike our nation without informing the other hostel country hostel sovereignty is to infinity and quick with respect to invasion although it is a long term target in order to have better territory linex stations one example of invasion from the recent past sir with respect to invention in 1999 Kargil attacks were Pakistan tried to infiltrate into India to have a better land territory graph opportunity there is one type of inventions to have a better is it an example of invasion or not that is my questions multiple definition with respect to International Flora but accepted only is called as aggressions thank you thank you what is refer to the historical structure which has been taken to have a better of any dead elders with respect to the ancient Sangam era and other historical ok was different from microlith from north India sir Meghalaya in terms of South India Meghalaya is more used for remembering the heroes or any other people's Memorial after death which is microwave these more refers to the tiny object that when we used with respect of the Civilization in North Indian food Geography types of land that have been mentioned in the Kurinji mullai marutham neithal Palai it means the land donation with respect to Hill forest and Agriculture land after the coastal plains and finally the oceans ok the name of all the five areas can you highlight the Gods and Goddesses associated with those areas because they have different I am not sure specifically about the gods in each and every answer over with respect to the mountains the Tamil God called as Murugan is being predominant administration tell me something about the differences refers to the any rural area where in villages has been been a part of the settlement in Nagaram it means more number of urban area so more about development and also economic opportunities in Sabha it may be more focused towards the Council of elders when important decisions are being taken by the members of the communities what is the difference between Bombay and agrahar refers to the land that has been donated to the Brahmins in order to have a better conservation of the land and also income support of the community with respect to the other half these are the land being used for the settlement per person and mainly used to protect the temple as a larger inscription in the southern part of Tamil excavated with respect to many posture and also gravity marking in which it is founded more number of ancient importance like predates the Sangam literature to more than a thousand five hundred BC earlier with respect to the historical significance we could test by only up to 600 BC now it is extending more back to 1500 will ask questions from my site that is regarding Devdas system what is the system has been more focused in India particular southern part of India has been donated to the service of the temples as a form of date customers to conduct Bharatanatyam dancers and also using this practice is still there the president has been abolished by the government of India and also the state government thank you 1985 in globalisation officially started a cross border movement of become larger in volume for frequent and this is also giving birth to more financial crimes which legal measures have been taken in last two decades or so to regulate this financial crimes sir as you said post globalisation that has been increasing use of money as a form of terrorism as a measure for XML after the 2011 attacks in the USA the fatf has been increasing boosted by the United Nations sorry by the G7 Nation in order to curve the money laundering that are used to find the terrorism purpose and apart from that recently we have been more focusing about giving sanctions towards the Nations by using the effects and also black list which prevents the further funding of the Giving safe events for the terrorism activities across the Nations sfi user it means serious for a fraud intelligence unit so it more Re focus upon the financial fraud crimes White Collar crimes which has more than more than around 100 crores if I am not wrong sir ok and it works under which ministry I do not know perfectly good I get in partial knowledge of finance minister and profit shifting it has been used by for in MNC trying to take away the income the atomic generate from one Nation without paying tax and two inner and take back to the host Nation so this is a form of tax aviations has the government of India taken any measure recently Government of India has able to have a better double taxation avoidance between the nation that prevents the base erosion and profit shifting sir I could not decision with respect to the rate of CIT corporate income tax is it related to web India has one of the lowest corporate tax and it is around 22 % and also recently India in order to have a better startup it decreases to the corporator of 15% to the start like new Enterprises so height affect the incentive for webs does it weekend the incentive for base erosion and profit shifting since the tax has been reduced it encourages the MNCs to pay tax with respect to India and what is tax heaven refers to the country's location where in the countries are very very less or taxi structure for operating the business in that area so it has been used for the many many countries to set up many shell companies which are used for illegal purpose and also legitimate business interest company refers to the companies we have been incorporated but they don't show any profit balance sheet so it means that they use for diverting the black money to form a white income Island is very small Island why it is in news is a form of tax saving territory which has increasingly used by the MNCs and also came an island from a predominantly FDA shows for many other developing Nations thank you sir Venkateshwara how India geography please role in internal security in advantages and disadvantages mainly related to the border the first advantage of the border with respect to Geography with respect to border securities that is we have a large number of mountains at the Chinese border prevents infiltration by the Chinese the second one sir since we have number of ocean security with respect to the southern and Eastern Western parts we have more number of Naval security by the by the countries armed forces but the disadvantage is that sir with respect to the northern North Western part of India due to the increase in change of river causes and also due to varied like wet mass lands it leads to many porous borders leading to way of many countries illegal tunnel concession leading to many infiltration with respect to the Eastern part of India due to a very camouflage and Hill structures or he will not forest topography and also unfinished border it leads to many infiltration drug trafficking tell me the geopolitics of Andaman and Nicobar Andaman Nicobar is strategic part of India and it forms a location where we have integrated theatre command and Port there is more close to the Asian nations that by providing a choke point with respect to the end of Pacific trade that is one of the concerns with respect to China moving more towards the a string of first theory and another aspects are the rising usage of tourism with respect to Andaman Nicobar Islands makes our way to have a better development and that leads to better jio strategic location don't you think that we have ignored the potential the economic potential of Andaman and Nicobar till now we have very less relatively significant less number of economic activity the reason is that it has a very less population and also we have no adverse amount of area for having a better connectivity this leads to less number economic development however in the recent times India has been able to have better internet connectivity and also trying to have better fibre optic cables which motor is a tourism and also economics there is a project on going for the development of Andaman and Nicobar do you have any idea about that sir with respect to the internet connectivity in general have you heard great Nicobar project yes sir what is the controversial great Nicobar has been planned to be created for both tourism and also the other strategic development the last words of forest land has been there for his development so it hammer the movement of various tribal groups and the ecosystem as well this is one of the applications India have different physiographic regions complement each other more number of forest area and also rich in rich in rainfall it leads to the rural settlements Like The structures of the houses or more towards the conical and circular nature this is first how we take my question is we have different physiographic regions I am not asking the characteristics how these different physiographic regions complement each other so as India as Northern parts with the more number of Himalayas and leads to better gangetic Plains it complements to the witches in respect to the Ganga satellite space moving towards better fertile with respect to agricultural and another person in Southern parts we have more number of Coastal Plains that leads to more number of fishing community complement each other meaning that the southern parts are more towards the aquaculture and other fishing processing activities and another geographical division is that we are able to have a desert at the North Western part of India so this makes our security to be correlated that prevents the adversary from finishing with the Nations ok as a student of Geography can you tell us some of the factors that affect the geographical factors that affect the culture of a place It will be the topography so if it plain area at least more number of economic agricultural and also Industrial Development but if it is the topography area there be a very more number of primary agriculture and very well for secondary and tertiary parts and second one is that with respect to the climatography so if the climate is very extreme such as North Western part of India it leads to more number of desertification resulting in less water intensive crops such as pulses being grown then but in on the other hand if there is good rainfall such as the Western Ghats are the North Eastern region it more focused towards other parts of food grains is serial and also whether those you come from the intelligence background can you think of some of the social indicators that relate directly with the notion of safety and security among the citizens of any country the first will be served with respect to the economic opportunity because if there is less number of economic opportunity and also less employment this makes the way the for the youth to go for the other easy levels of income for example in types of Northeast more number drug peddling has been used by the unemployment social factor and second social factor is that the rising investigations of nuclear families for example with respect to various urban urban Urban cities due to rising rise of nuclear families it leads to many type of Intercity such as usage of drugs and also other forms of social elaborate that hamper Association you talked about economic opportunities the lack of economic opportunities but contrary to this believe we see that as we are becoming more and more economically developed the crimes against women and other weaker sections of the society are also going up so do you see a correlation here yes you right it is called a transition phase first point is that due to the rise in nuclear family the family relation decrease and this act as a debtor and for their Activity the second one sir due to more number of income disparity due to the rise in income of a nation this leads to the more number of the theft robbery against the weakest session this increase the crime rate and third one as import and try to come up to a source of society this makes some vulnerable towards the victims towards the law and order injustices because early they are part of the household but the positive outcome of their movement is has been illegally moved by social elements despite secularism being recognised as an intrinsic part of the basic feature the Supreme Court has agreed to her a petition seeking the removal of the term secular from the constitution why the court has taken such a stand quotes the Supreme Court has agreed to hear a petition in this regard as these words secular and has been added in during the 1970s and it's a part of the Preamble can be amended as a part of the Constitution as a part of democracy the Supreme Court has accepted to hear the petitions so what was the need of introducing these terms in the constitution was entire constitution already secular census Inception sir our nation is highly secular that is no doubt about it however after the Independence due to Rapid rise with respect to communal riots and also the bad effects with respect to partition made the government to make sure that any law in the future should be made sure that it is made of secular so that the states counterparts of the nation don't turn against its ok thank you thank you sir have you ever visit tip of India's Island supposed to be connecting the two what is that is so is it real Bridge or is a pathological Bridge there is supposed to be a bridge called Adam's Bridge so is it real Bridge or not the focal Ram Setu it made up of limestone shows and also Shallow depression so it is mythology mythological is seen as a more number of a bridge that has been created but scientifically it is just a sediments that has been created due to the ocean currents NASA has its own findings ISRO has his own set of findings so why there is so much of controversy around this fridge on the study of Geography shows and also some Shallow deposits that integrate with respect to Dhanushkodi and also the manner islands so be used as a movie movement between the two Nations and presently there has been step by the government to construct waterway in order to better transport connectivities final question before we let you go do you think it is possible to eradicate corruption from the government working sir to the immediate future or the in the within the next feature it is not possible to add corruption because it has been evolved over the period of time so what we can be efficiently do is that occupying the community by saying that your Greece will be addressed by the administration is a positive steps for example toll free number 7th we are going to wear this shoes only black shoes also have been working in the government go in black shoes OK your time is very fleshy I hope you are coming all the way from Tamil Nadu that is why you are feeling the cold here I hope when you go for the interview the third piece will not be there should not how you have done in your neither you will be very clear how I have performed in your Mains examination tell you and we tried to ask a question from wide range of issues and by and large perfect in your response your communication skill is very good analytical mind is also very effective so you could think of alternatives before coming to a conclusion for giving your opinion good qualities of a prospective cell Tamilnadu and you have a work experience for 5 years three years so whatever questions we have asked some of the questions will be revolving around that what were the questions will go is very difficult for us to tell you also but something will definitely be there so multiple Agencies multiple organisation doing the same work what are the final destination between organisations we talk about CID there is a ID so many Agencies are there you must be very clear about the specific role of all these Agencies and their interplay ok so that is very important then recruitment to your organisation from various channels are there police service revenue Service also from the defence personnel and all that so it is started in mystery and public is not in the public domain what you guys are doing in such a way that no secrets are divisible so that is one number to you are coming from Tamil Nadu your we have been offer talking about the models of development state models of development what is the model of development and all that ok if not prepared just have a look at that then why Tamil Nadu has become a hub of textile sector good sector and all that so so what are the what what incentives are given by the government to encourage your textile industry in then you are from Kanyakumari district famous any questions can be used by site what is the significance of that what is the significance of Vivekananda is message and all that student of geography so many questions are there this Shri Ram Setu as because you healing from that area there is every possibility that somebody will ask question don't you very definite about that is a sedimentary and all that ok just go back and study on this what the experts have to say about that and then say that is truth lies somewhere in between them you can't understand belief a very strong belief that there was also and all that so before complete you have problem exactly exactly and try to understand intent of the question in our colleagues question first time you could not understand what was the intent of the question yes sir person try to quickly understand what is the content collect your thoughts for the second and then you come out with your answers so you will do very well again the shape of tongue while expanding the organisational happening in Chennai and Tamil and the of course political issues are there must have prepared but you will do wonderful in the interview on assessment is that you are going to get very good marks in your interview this time interview will not let you down in fact it will help you in Getting higher position also if you have really well in your Mains examination both the scores combined together see you in the list of successful candidate in our mind if you have any specific questions to ask you have a small like you have to share as anyone to tell you if you have anything in mind what do you have in mind that needs support the UPC mobile application for example currently the mobile application lacks videos are current affairs or any relevant materials so if indicated can be used by the various candidates even at the remote places and rural people so that they use usage for the appeal for civil service examination will be increased by a good good suggestion good suggestion yes if you get an opportunity gots so you don't appear to be very pedantic in your approach that you are teaching them in my humble submission I find that if this area is also covered I don't know how far this has got your attention Sir but this is one area in my little understanding I feel that this is one area if it could be your Limited understanding and all that all use all those caves all those adjectives so that members don't feel offended way of saying the same thing isn't it if it is humbler way of saying kind of always humility and all that and with your Limited knowledge is the Limited understanding of the subject so this is what I feel if I allowed to ask the good luck question from the board chairman that if you have anything to ask questions for you
