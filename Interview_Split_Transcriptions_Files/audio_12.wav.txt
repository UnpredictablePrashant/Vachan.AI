quality control in a civil engineering project and how it is different from Quality Assurance a Reform sedition law is in the new the Bhartiya Sanhita 150 now what is that particular law what is your idea of Patriotism can you tell me some of the important steps that government has taken around Lucknow define Lucknow in three words good morning good morning good morning please give a brief introduction about yourself my name is belong to Lucknow Uttar Pradesh I my schooling from Lucknow Public School in the sector I region of Lucknow and then I graduated in bachelors in civil engineering from IIT Roorkee since then I've been preparing for civil services my hobbies and interest include cricket following chest streams and also reciting Bhagwat Geeta pastor from IIT Roorkee Civil Engineering with very high CGPA why did you don't go for the campus placements in my third year of graduation I decided that I had to go into this field of civil services explore the various options available and was very interested by the Diversity on offer here if you get into the civil services and you are asked to overview a project of national importance then how will you balance environmental and social economic while planning and executing a project first of all as you said planning a project is very important so what is the scale of the project what are the materials involved what is the goal of the Project objective of the project these things have to be taken into account and then as is followed in the governmental processes we have to do an environmental impact assessment also social impact assessment in terms of how many people will be displayed or what will over the life cycle of the project what will be the pollution concerns for what will be the wastage concerns so these things will have to be taken into account but the most important thing will be the safety of the structure and how it can stand up to its performance objective those things will have to be considered what do you mean by quality control in a civil engineering project and how it is different from Quality Assurance that I am not exactly awareness by ris maintenance engineering project refers to how we can control a structure from various amount of risk such as seismic risk failure risk failure can also be occur in various modes such as buckling or load failure Foundation failure so controlling a structure and assuring a factor of safety from each of these failures is risk management heavy opted for mathematics as your optional subject mathematics has always been very dear to me since my early days and civil engineering also involves a lot of mathematics and most importantly as a analysed that which people become more successful in this examination so based on that analysis I took mathematics models different spheres of working as per the government is concerned suppose if with a background of mathematics and all you are asked to apply multiple mathematical model in the energy sector what ideas can come to your mind particularly in the field of Energy Management to be very precise currently government is exploring regarding hybrid model of energy like ethanol is being mixed with diesel and petrol and also renewable energy and fossil fuel energy these are balanced government is trying to balance the aspects of development and the aspects of Climate Change so using a mathematical model we can analyse what exactly proportion is required in terms of ethanol and diesel which is best shooting the individuals and also the corporates and public are more accepting it in general so by running a mathematical model we can analyse and arrive at a right proportion of our mix for a fossil fuel and renewable energy and in terms of ethanol and diesel suppose if you are asked to present a mathematical model to as to optimise your energy production and distribution how will you go about it first of all we will need to analyse what are the customers or who are the people needing the energy so based on that we will see what amount of production is needed what are the materials needed what are the plants needed and then we will see how efficient we can make that production process by running a model secondly distribution like various grades have to be made so the exact note points the exact wires or exact sources these will need to be analysed on various things and then see which is the most efficient distribution method thank you sir Aditya you are coming from Uttar Pradesh Uttar Pradesh has been news because of some important words like bulldozer politics right also some police encounter what is your stand on this on police Encounters they have to be the last resort and in terms of self defence only anything against the domain of law or outside the established procedures is wrong in my view and on the bulldozer issue these have to be done as per the standard operating procedure the particular individual whose house or shop is demolished he needs to be served the proper notice and given a chance to be heard as per the principles of natural justice that is absolutely fine and principle of natural justice must be followed but my question to you is it is a kind of political gimmick now most of the states have started copying this expression right for population what is the solution bulldozer is the solution to my question to you is that how you can say correct it would be when in the context of realising this values of governance or rather the politician must follow ethical probability in terms of conducting those you can say actions so what is your view in that is it are we going in the right direction in that contact listening to the people and going outside the domain of law is never right we have to remain in the domain of law and but on the flip side is that we should not be scared from bold actions but they have to be asked law but bold action should not be a flagship program and that needs to be adopted everywhere they should be adopted when they are as per the rules on so I would say government can take this action but they have to be as per the processes and if they go outside we are not next question to you is addition law is also very much in news right now I would say a Reform sedition law is in the news Sanhita 150 now what is that particular law government has changed it from rajdroh to Desh through now where you are earlier anyone who tried to insight dissection against the government was charged under the sedition law but now it has to be against the nation earlier law was initiated by colonial Masters and they did so as to rule the country but now it has been changed in the literal sense West to imply that we are protecting the country just the law was colonial that is why the law of particularly has been changed or some other reasons are there Law Commission has reported that and commission has recommended even more strict laws and the sedition law it was being used some of the criticism of the Government and being used out of the proportion not as per the proportion to which the crime was committed or the action was done so and what action what what was used how how have you substantiated your contact where it was sir I cannot recall the exact pose at the moment but various sources have reported that some of the journalists were being Temple down using this law and black police authorities were not using it as per the proportion in which it was needed and also it implied that anything criticizing the government is wrong for government wanted to imply that no any your action which excites instability of nation is wrong not against the government so terminate as a desh throw I think is a right step ok so you believe that freedom of speech and expression must be resistant right that is why that is what your opinion yes sir but it should have reasonable restrictions as outlined in our constitution also the report related to oxfam report 2023 that the very report release something was talking about socialistic aspects of our economy if you consider that particular report you come to know that 1% of the people are controlling 40% of the wealth right now what kind of trend are we are what kind of trend are we right now into could you please tell me that are we going into the right direction of as our socialistic aspiration has advocated for I also came across such report and it implies that a fair share of proportion of wealth is controlled by the corporates but we need to look at this issue from multiple aspects if we look at the multidimensional poverty index report of Niti Aayog the party has decreased from 25 % to around 15% and also if we see are advances in education field in terms of health field mortality rate is decreasing in terms of Human Development indicators we are improving day by day at the micro level yes but because of the inflowing investment India growing as a market and also growing on as a economy as a whole the top the cream at the top is bound to grow so this report reflects that the cream the person the big corporates are growing but if we look at other human development indicators also we are growing at the micro level so I don't think it is a major issue but yes we need to bridge the inequality and so that most of our population is in balance in every one gets a good quality what what was the report all about how it actually brought an impact in on our foreign this particular economy have you seen that criticized the policies and actions of specific also very curious that some of the reports published by some of the international firm give me some International Media House actually can affect our economy now what has the government done so far to you can say control the negative sentiment spread across the boundary or across the territory so what what what what what what what what when wrong because for a few period of time something actually was not working right for our stock market the could you please highlight some of the issues related to that as you said specifically the Adani group for some of its policies related to short selling and hence I cannot recall exact but initial public offer rights on offer especially was not taken up by the public and its stock started going down and also within of course various reports came out that reputed that particular claim to my question is what has the government done so far because some of the report come and go it actually is affecting directly what where are we functioning or where which part we are actually lacking my question to you is that where are you doing in everything in the right direction with regard to corporate policy I think we can bring an element of Trust between Government and specially foreign companies also so that various disputes related to Vodafone can be settled in that sense and in terms of this criticism I think right messaging following a standard protocols and also transparency can bring good things what is your idea of Patriotism my idea of Patriotism is being allowing myself to develop to the full potential to serve the country in my and also following the laws articles of the constitution and fundamental duties of the country the best Which kind of jobs country the best I don't have any job which can serve the country in the best way possible every individual has a specific RO play and if they play their role to the full potential and try to improve their serving country in the best way have you heard about this silent power Energy Crisis that happening in Uttar Pradesh and a lot of people are dying also due to the heat wave have you heard about it I am aware of the heat wave issue but silent Power Crisis specific term have not much idea about ok has become the second largest contributor to India's economy if you have to point out to three factors that are responsible for it what would you say first of all the government with respect to protocols and policies has made doing business easy way ranked second in ease of doing business by Niti Aayog also government is inviting investment proposal from diverse group of corporates last year Global investors Summit was organised and in which around 25000 deals wearing so we are making relations with the corporates also in terms of skill India missions of Government of India and up we have also made good progress and last year education policy has also increased in 5 to 6 years with cheating in exams reducing more focus on increasing the quality of education with respect to Diksha app so at micro level we are also doing good which is increasing our output in the employment sector can you tell me what is Vedic Maths Vedic Maths was a series of sutras written by Bhartiya Krishna Tirth and it outlines how to solve basic mathematical calculations in an easy in my knowledge it is not related to Vedas ok you also have interest in reading Bhagavad Gita can you recite a verse here which is your favourite my favourite is here God speaking Shri Asansol hi Mahabharat in the previous words Arjuna asked Lord Krishna that mind is so difficult to control its as fast has been how to control it so Krishna is saying to Arjuna yes you are right it is very difficult to control even best people fail to do it but abhyasen by repeated practice and where are gained by renunciation you can control The Mind from Shrimad Bhagwat Geeta is there I think full name people right there is no difference when we say Shrimad then we are adding an element of respect here in my knowledge you have to change one thing about Uttar Pradesh what would that what I have witnessed in public life and in my experience in general I want to change the condition of Uttar Pradesh especially if I move to top hospitals in my area especially SGPGI people are lined up they are coming from far away of the region sleeping on the ground waiting for long life government is propagating its Policies but due to the issues of demography population difficulties and growing surrounding change like climate change and noncommunicable diseases we are not able to progress we rank last in health security index of Niti Aayog and average spending is also around 450 per capita on health so it is very bad synonym can you tell me some of the important steps that government has taken around there was a mission by Indian Space Research Organisation part of Sun and it is position that the element that government is seeking to gain from solar parts so what is the aim of government with respect to National Solar Mission I cannot recall the exact objective in terms of quantification of energy but it is establishing solar parks and rooftop programs organised Surya Mitra a capacity building initiative is organised and are renewable energy policy rest on the shoulders of solar energy because it is the most viable as far as current situation to create a complete atmosphere for the development of solar energy with regards to industries and also related Industries there so that we can create better supply chains and development of solar energy by 2022 which we have not been able to attend even in 2023 what went on what was not hitting the target we are progressing in the right manner but as far as issues are concerned land acquisition policies are still not easy people protest whenever land is acquired recently there was a protest in Tamil Nadu secondly in terms of manufacturing of solar cells we need to import a large amount of cells from China and thirdly we need we like a Holistic approach to the policy like in Ladakh large amount of land is available sun is available but evacuation infrastructure is not taking care of all the specs resolving land issues and building sector will be talk about Solar Energy is largely considered as environment friendly is it really as far as in my knowledge some amount of pollution is always there in terms of life cycle setting up infrastructure there and amount of pollution is always done but we always see the relative advantage and in terms of relative advantage we are better talk about the energy there has been the tripling of nuclear energy in the last UPSC paper 28 why do you think the world is shifting back towards nuclear energy and do you think it's going to be successful that pursuing this nuclear energy as energy solution nuclear energy is not renewable energy but if we see harm to the environment is it is very less as compared to the conventional forms of energy such as fossil fuels and also recently in America scientist discovered that fusion reaction was possible if we see the scope of fusion is very big in this fusion generates almost 100 times the energy as compared to be able to scale fusion at a big level I think this pledge is available countries have signed on the pledge why not more nations are a bit for this if that is the solution for the future shows of energy of the exact reason but if you allow me I'll try to attempt because nuclear raw material is not easily available to all the countries and consensus among the developing countries and third world countries is that nuclear energy has been reduced to Monopoly of the permanent 5 and these countries especially India also lags behind in access to quality uranium so this might be the reason second this also may like use of nuclear energy may again involved in the organisation in some way these might be the fees recently in India we had seen the tunnel collapse in Uttarakhand what were the Civil Engineering lapses when this happened like you were talking about the risk assessment also so what exactly happened and do you think that entire Char Dham project when you look at it from Civil Engineering perspective as well as from the environmental concerns in a vulnerable as a project in terms of civil engineering are honorable Minister Nitin Gadkari said that all the protocols were followed and I will take his word but the scientist said that when the repeated excavations were done the previous layer of Rock fragments they disintegrated to the collapse happened secondly there was a proposal initially in the environmental impact assessment report that a service road could be constructed or an emergency tunnel and so but the constructors went ahead with widening the entire road and not constructing that channel for better management of traffic which is right but I think safety could have been factored in but it looks in hindsight I think we can say anything but more question would have helped secondly in terms of Char Dham project Constructions in environmentally sensitive regions of Himalayas is always difficult and civil engineers we take it up as a challenge to first of all I think environmental impact assessment needs to be look down and if it says that it is Bible it needs to be followed but I think with the rapidly changing climate change and also altering topography is we need to repetitive what is the status of ground there what is status of general climate there and then proceed ahead with Constructions because if assessment is done in 2050 the situation might not be same in 2024 when you look at the world right now we are seeing to major Wars going on not saying an end in this scenario do you think that unsc and u n g a still hold relevance if yes why have there been no consensus on ceasefire and two if not then why is Industrial processing the dream of having a seat in unsc I will say that they still hold relevance but in relative terms effective action has been lacking but if we see the stance of various countries lots of negotiations are done on a single resolution what is the exact wording of resolution so this reflects the importance of United Nations and what statement it makes at the global level so I think it is still relevant in the current context but in terms of effective action the composition of Security Council needs to change the ruling regarding related to Veto needs to change and we need to see how we can take decisions with a better consensus and better interest for the word because V2 resolution allows a participant to the war like Russia to get away easily if we can Alter The processes and composition of unsc and the decision making at unga I think we can change the current relevance of United Nations and make it for better when is maths Day celebrated for India and when is the international match day celebrated India it is 22nd December the birth anniversary of Srinivasa Ramanujan and international mathematics day and cannot record at the present you are from Lucknow define Lucknow in three words any of the three words of your by which you can describe Lucknow the city of other cuisines and Diversity by Lucknow is part of Awadh right and in Ayodhya there is a big Ram temple which is going to be inaugurated what is the relevance of this Ram temple specially on Economy of Uttar Pradesh I am sorry sir as if we look at the status of Shri Ram is one of the principal Gods in Hinduism it is Ayodhya is his birth place so a big temple specially at Ayodhya which has been among the news for last so many I think it is a big tourist attraction and people from all over the country will come and an Airport is also being constructed there so a lot of employment is already being generated and if people start coming then a lot of ancillary Industries related to tourism will be set up their and if we look at Ayodhya and Lucknow from Purvanchal Expressway takes hardly 1.5 hours so the development of at Ayodhya will Trickle down to Lucknow in various ways and more and more Industries will invest here with lots of tourism tourist coming up fine you have studied mathematics also right there is a change in calculation of human development index in earlier methodology we were calculating the average through Arithmetic mean now we are calculating it through Geometric mean why this change happened and what are the advantages of specific reasons behind the change but in various calculations we prefer a geometric mean to Arithmetic mean because Arithmetic mean is the processes from both the sides are equal but in reality whenever we to consider two quantities they are in different phases or different conditions and circumstances so often Geometric mean gives us the better value like to towards which thing ideal waste tilted because in Arithmetic mean will get the exact middle value 12 and 20 we will get to middle value around 15 16.8 in geometric mean towards which higher the actual value is tilted we get that and harmonic mean is also better in calculation fine fine what is Fibonacci series and what is its role in common day today life Fibonacci series is a special series in which sum of previous two numbers is equal to the third number and if we see like life around us in terms of petals snails the following the number of curves in previous to rotations is equal to the curves in next rotation right as your hobby is watching cricket match right there has been reports of recent change in we worship of cricket matches now Pakistan cricket matches not one of the favorites right what are the other Trends shifting Trends of the viewership pattern of this cricket matches if we see their now there are two modes of your shipping the app based viewership and television based viewership and if we see the two major players jio and Disney star they have made watching cricket free especially for big tournaments like IPL in World Cup so people are working day and night in terms of differentiation is rising among general Indian population India Pakistan cricket match is Losing its scene now people are shifting Tourister performance of Indian team we have repeatedly Beat It Pakistan in most of the events this regarding one or two but if we see overall performance we have not wear any Trophy for since 10 years people are interested in what we are doing in most significant matches not in group match or a League match that's why my last question to you is that you are a student of civil engineering also what is green cement and what what is its relevance in context to environment when we associate green with any word we point out to the environment friendly aspect of the active Cement in which from production levels we make as much as carbon intensive materials and also the amount of water involved is also less so that it is water efficient that is a green cement with as in India which is still a developing country and cannot shift immediately to more advanced materials green cement is a good concept so as to make our buildings green buildings and environment friendly in general thank you say that you receive Bhagavad Gita what I proposed to do Gita slokas I'll recite a few slogans I will speak first sentence I have to complete the second largest country called this is my second item in your Romance I think I have done better but I cannot be sure of My Life OK I think how was your experience today weather it was a learning experience I need to improve on certain things but yes I got to learn very first day of interview drastically goes wrong with you you are going to get a very good permission all that but in this indicate of the suit says that when when you come when you sit down and then when you go back again so that that is the only flower in entire thing that when you entered your buttons were on you shut down also just try to be relax that is the whole purpose you are a man of varied interest IITian with mathematics and Geeta these are very very strange the combination but true in your case you have convert cell communication skill is very good you could communicate your ideas really frankly and with a plan so maintain your utility maintain your natural cell and any contention issue try to give a very balanced answer don't take any extreme step against government Pro government but don't take any experience and your person scramble of thinking to very very such question comes try to demonstrate that part of your personality also by giving some order box solutions some wonderful ideas then what kind of questions will be asked very difficult for us to tell you also what kind of questions will be asked you are boy from Uttar Pradesh Uttar Pradesh news last few years particularly on the on the one head development of Uttar Pradesh of investment is trying to the foreign investment what are the implications of that Ram Mandir is already there corridors have been constructed all around then your Ganga Vilas Cruise project is there what kind of questions very difficult for me to tell you and particularly respect to 34 areas your infrastructure area education in Uttar Pradesh agriculture rural development and the schemes launched by the state government and the central government is the larger context of your what you call that Ambedkar wise have confidence in yourself you have clarity of thought state honest thought which is very important a personal integrity and honesty of purpose is seen while discussing has to be honest that was reflected interaction with you that was good honesty is very good clarity is there in you and stand by what you say don't try to where if you have taken a stand and you think it is a logical standby that don't buckle under pressure otherwise you are going in this dress only I will change the shirt inside it will be a white shirt otherwise I think this video if you are wearing a white shirt is good that you have any specific question in mind feel free to ask otherwise just have confidence and got a feedback from some other panels and my parents and relatives that I seem a bit tensed in the interview sometimes what degree you feel that the way you are speaking the way you are engaging us so that aspect was not very prominent is always good to be looking very come to the board with a smiling face is always good with the positive body language and look was also I do not palpable this reverse a sign of nervous system has not palpable internally one has to be nervous but it should not reflect odd word that is what the purposes but it's ok don't don't worry much about that try to face the boat with smiling face just doesn't take much effort in developing that habit otherwise good all good anything else you want
