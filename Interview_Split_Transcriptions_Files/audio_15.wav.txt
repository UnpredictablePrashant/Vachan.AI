trillion economy what are the learnings from Mumbai Dabbawala that a corporate or even the administration can adopt you are an IT Engineer tell me what do you understand by cloud computing means of the board so my name is Anup Tiwari and 25 years old I have completed my schooling and ice cooling from Mumbai I have completed my graduation in information technology from Mumbai there after a worked in corporate sector for one and a half years and now I am preparing for civil services examination you work for almost three years that initially you join the company where you are drawing a salary of 58000 there after you left and join another company where your salary was reduced to 40000 years initially campus placement and later on sir I was preparing simultaneously for civil services examination also so it and taken a job which was little comfortable for me considering that have to work as well as manage time for study engineering graduate why have you opted subject sociology paper for the Civil Services Sir after studying four years for engineering I thought I need little fresh starts with that is why it took humanity subject to reduce the monotonous subject graduation subject because studying that subject for 5 years 6 years for meet kills it brings more boredom and kills innovation so for that reason I took sociology it will be something new which I can start the fresh and the learning curve will be again good in the start you as a subject in policy formulation in the government to understand what exactly are the challenges faced by society by every section of the society how society move from one form to another for example from a Industrial Estate to a post Industrial state of post modern state how patriarchy is visible in different forms in society how even people with western Outlook still have a Indian culture in the that we can help me formulate better policies and I can be more adaptable can you explain the term patriarchy for us patriarchy is a system in which men assume greater power preference and privileges as compared to other genders do you think everything is bad in patriarchy or something good is also there in patriarchy the basic training of humanity will be good but Restaurant Delhi bad because it is assumed that man carry greater power privileges and how to perform women in every aspect and it is an assumption is created write in the beginning and based on that the capability of women and women are just done your graduation in it tell me sociology for technology shipping social interactions in the present day country so especially during covid times the new way of digital interaction where even when relatives or friends were a Each Other they used Skype meetings then there were Skype weddings happening along with that movements like me to movements are saved womens women movements across the world even without physical connections along with that sir I feel that people are better able to assess their position in the society they are more integrated into the society especially at The Grass root level where panchayats and social audits are done by a digital media so that we does digitally integrated with the society what negative impact it has made in the social interactions with the buyers and state which is created it spreads very fast secondly the body shaming which happens on digital platforms is something we have to be aware of individual level if you look at the growth of a child to adolescence more used to the mobile phones and digital gadgets right since a very young age after three or four years itself their growth is on YouTube and they prefer watching mobile phones so that way yes the one aspect is mental health and second is eyes and other disorders of the body which we have to be aware of you are basically from Mumbai presently staying in Mumbai from Mumbai preparing for UPSC suppose I want to amend my voter ID card could you please tell me what is the procedure for amending the voter ID card you have a voter ID card right please tell me require an address proof for it which I will have to show it to the government election commission of ok so you never bothered to check how to amend the voter ID card so that according to the regional offices of election commission of India to which we have to submit our directly approach regional office what the government has been doing have any idea about it so I think there is an online application also for it on which we can update our documents and the change document and then we can it can come tomorrow fundamental duties now according to you which fundamental duties best and what are those fundamental duties you believe or what are the duties that you believe that it should be added in part 4 of the Indian Constitution duties are necessary for properly tell me some fundamental duties to avoid by the national ideals national flag national anthem that is one to protect wildlife environment and ok to respect the dignity of women that is another fundamental duty which fundamental duties is article number I don't remember ok then sorry in 51 the which one out of the 10 I don't remember you don't know your fundamental duties sir I don't know but I don't remember the numbers now you are talking about covid-19 pandemic right and but why we have seen that because you are a sociology student but why we have seen that the cases of domestic violence we have seen that there are of course rise of those cases domestic violence in particular and of course there are situation which has resulted in lot of matrimonial dispute that occurred during the covid-19 so my question to you is because you are a sociology student why these things actually happened how would you analyse with the perspective of sociology from sociological point of view firstly since people were more connected than ever they started entering the personal species of each other which started to create a degree of tension between the relatives husband wife or for that matter parents and the child that was one reason secondly as far as we are in a technological world the impact of digital media was quite high on everyone so it was more visible the violence was more reported more visible because people could directly complaint via digital media on cyber cell for that reason for these are the two main reasons why there was a increase in cases come from Mumbai to Delhi distance yes it's a cosmopolitan cosmopolitan city in Delhi something about Red Fort is going to play a very important role in India becoming a 5 trillion economy and Maharashtra has its own goal of becoming a 1 trillion economy what makes you believe that Maharashtra will be able to become 1 trillion economy the current GDP of Maharashtra is around 500 billion dollars and they expected to be 1 trillion dollars for that they have Maharashtra industrial policy along with that stable law and order system safety and a good business environment where Maharashtra has been on the top of attracting the FDI for the last one decade I feel that is the primary reason why Maharashtra will be able to maintain a sustainable development GST collection from Maharashtra is one of the highest what is it that makes people you know comply with GST and not even tax in Maharashtra is there anything cultural in Maharashtra will established system and there are special economic zones there is seized in Andheri in Mumbai so their most of the companies are located and from their most of the GST comes so about evolution of tax I think mam it is a national feature going on everywhere but this term which has some context with Maharashtra have you heard about this time sociology can you tell me any example of patriarchal bargain that you have seen in your life company itself when I see that males are compatible at a higher position compared to women so the women starts bargaining with the system for power and women is not able to is not given the rights or the powers which she actually deserves in the society starts bargaining with the system itself for maintaining our self identity and what is an enemy can you give me an example of Enemy from your life from my life was during covid time when the it was a monotonous work life sitting from home and I could not differentiate between professional work culture and home work culture I become fearful I think of the deep case of an actress that happened to productivity in the economy but the fear that it brings how do you think we can you deal with that fever International collaboration firstly is needed the recent step of Delhi declaration on AI was a good step in this direction because AI is not a national phenomena is it can spread across the borders and it is what to do this what what are my options right now let's I am using any platform and it goes wrong I am currently there is no specific provision as such but it is covered under under Information Technology Act Section 43a where your if the Private data is linked or it is not used in a proper way then it can attract certain provisions as of now but government is planning to introduce certain AI laws in India and it is taking help from Niti Aayog it will not replaceable at them in the decision making that is the most important thing Smart City management land usage everything it can be better if we use it will help in policy decision making to a great extent you are from Mumbai and right now you are residing in Delhi Delhi is very badly known for its pollution The Bad air quality and interestingly sin few years Mumbai is also facing the same problem of that Bad air quality so what are the specific reasons for Mumbai air becoming bad as compared to I mean other cities Delhi is more notice for pollution because the media houses are located here and it becomes very important Mumbai in the last two years is also showing a lot of pollution the main difference between Delhi and Mumbai is that Delhi is surrounded by cities on all the sides neighbouring states and cities so it becomes a gas chamber whereas in Mumbai it is located on island on all four sides of three sides so for that reason the pollution disperses of but recently due to increase in urbanization and redevelopment is happening a lot in Mumbai every three story 4 story building has been converted into 20 floor Tower so for that reason on every Street around 10-15 buildings are undergoing construction so that is releasing a lot of ash fly ash and other action is a major issue in that is for you have worked incorporates also incorporates we study about one of the particular sectors of Mumbai which is called as Mumbai Dabbawala right what are the learnings from Mumbai Dabbawala that a corporate or even the administration can adopt I think of Harvard and I am Bangalore also based on the bowlers efficiency so basically only one out of 10 lakh them is placed other than that everything is delivered properly and it is a very good networking of people they use public transport they use all green facilities like bicycle and public transport only so in that way we can learn the green concept from them and secondly the management is quite good they have local networks and the logistical support which they get from the government is something we can learn from my you are student of sociology also in recent times we have seen that some of the dominant caste groups right like marathas are the ones they are demanding for reservation right what is your your take on that should I think marathas do deserve reservation deserve the reservation thing but however sir one thing is that the 96 Clans which form the marathas is still very not very clear so in that way government has set up a committee to identify which are the needy communities secondly Honorable Supreme Court has said that out of the last 60 years around 35 years has been under Maratha chief ministers and marathas occupy a prominent position in every section of the administration so in that case Supreme Court said that while eating the 50% Indira Gandhi judgement case is not right in case of Maratha reservation so the only way it can be done is by including them in OBC under farmers however government is deciding that which needy Maratha should be given reservation under the OBC category you are also student of Information Technology there are allegations on government of snooping or spying the data of opposition leaders and journalists through some of the specific spywares like Pegasus how I mean how can we avoid such kind of spying even if suppose I am I am a journalist how can I make myself safe from these five years so firstly we should not click on any unwanted links you should be aware of the apps which we are downloading we should regularly update our Android or the iOS system and we should follow guidelines of the government whatever it is saying that a particular application needs to be uninstalled we need individual point of view is concerned and as far as other stakeholders the government and private players are concerned I think open source software are helping in tackling this where individual hackathon challenges for modification on the existing platforms makes the platform more robust right and my last question to you is that give us some of the tips through which we can save our privacy from our data being linked through this Aadhar to places where it is not necessary or where it is not needed as such for example if you are entering a restaurant and if it is demanding and other it is it does not point of giving there so why is use of other is the main thing because digital privacy is in our hands the way we use our data the way we give our data to someone that is the issue and as far as government data is concerned there needs to be better mechanisms to ensure that the recent issue of data theft from other open again for that we need government is developing its own cloud Meghraj and there are many more things where we will have our own cloud on systems in place thank you no you are an IT Engineer tell me what do you understand by cloud computing Cloud Computing is a technology where data is fed into a massive cloud basically is a term which means a set of data storage technique were huge amounts of data can be stored processed analyse the type of services that we get from Cloud Computing infrastructure as a service platform as a service software as a service and which are the government schemes for government programs which are making use of cloud computing in India is a application where we can Store our digital document are you making yourself which type of documents you have stored Aadhaar PAN card and driving licence now in Ai there is a famous experiment which is known as Chinese room experiment can you tell me what is Impact statement is it to do with the go go experiment International relations so there has been this conflict going on between Israel and Indian government stand on that stands for two Nation theory where it recognises Palestine as an independent country however it is for peaceful resolution is Palestine a member of United Nations so far it does not being status entity also has observed status which is that Gaza strip there has been some talk about climate change negotiations that have just taken place so with this where does this cop 28 to please so what is the new development with the loss and damage fund and what is it Los Angeles have not read about cop 28 so far you also have sociology as your optional can you tell me what is intersectional approach in Sociology approach means that when we study any social phenomena it should be studied from multiple points of view for example women transgender similarly black women white women so intersectional approach then another one is that we take multiple layers of approach for example a dalit women or a transgender Delhi women that is third level of intersectionality they are the most oppressed correct my last question to you what is Boxing in social media doxine Indian Penal Code CrPC and Evidence Act have been renamed first what are the change names of IPC CrPC and Evidence Act Indian Evidence Act is Bhartiya IPC address and Bhartiya Nagrik Suraksha Samiti made in the Act what major changes have been affected in the Bhartiya Sangeet terrorism is first time included into the list of offences and a proper tenure for imprisonment is given to it secondly terrorism or certain other words have also unlawful and Anti National activities have been defined and secondly sir mob linching has been introduced this time and strict cases against it has been taken thirdly sir domestic violence violence against women and child rape the penalty level for these has been raised to a higher level someone has a physical relationship with a woman on the promise of marriage and he back side then what happens when is your interview 17 January which attempt is this for you second attempt and first interview ok how was your experience today assess your performance environment and certain sections are a bit weak because I'm not covered idiot you see you are a good candidate certain things which must tell you so that those things don't happen when you go for the interview when you entered you did not get anybody just entered casually this is a big Knows by 10% at least because these are the matters of 8088 and the prospective Civil Servant is not supposed to be compromising on the issues of 888 so once you enter when you go for the interview make sure that you entered with a positive body language from the chairman to give you the permission to set then only should set that is one area where we saw you faulted like anything so that is first take away from this mock that they should not happen when you go for the interview OK it is very important otherwise what happens the very first impression is the last impression that is number one you are basically an IT Engineer work in private sector update for sociology so we have a very very background questions on anything and everything related but focus will be because you have an interest in Ai also so some questions related to technology what way it will be asked to write in our own way to ask a certain questions as is not important how you respond to those questions is very important so at times what we found while you are speaking that certain questions your where are you didn't know didn't know doesn't matter But wherever you didn't know they are also try to make an attempt that should be strictly avoided you don't know doesn't matter like cop 28 although you are supposed to be knowing topic everybody knows it so when you go back to read about 28 all that is why this fund and all that was asked questions on the fund was asked so once you have understood the subject you will understand and it relates to climate change is related to environment energy so many things are there so all the issues are there little time is there you refresh your current affairs OK then you are topical issues opinion based issues like Maratha reservation should it be given or not you are free to take a point of view what it should be given quotient logical explanation for that you think of that because you are working in Maharashtra probably and this is one of the important issues some questions related to this video so if you are endorsing it supporting it give two type of thing so current affairs you should brush up then you should not be asking a contract question to a board member discussing about the AI Chinese room experiment and all that you ask the board member are you mean this is not the way of asking a contract question regarding your Israel and Palestine your answer was two Nation theory is to stay not to Nation isn't it two state theory so you have to be very careful about choosing the words selection of words is very important otherwise you have all the good qualities of becoming a good Civil Servant have confidence in yourself go with a positive body language don't forget about all those formalities and all that you should you are going to wearing this shirt only is coming out and all that make sure that when you go for the interview right now you are sitting with one button open one button closed why feel free to tell me why why I asked you to before so that you don't for that is important ok otherwise just work on these things and you will be doing good your knowledge base is very nice wherever you knew you knew it is the way how you present yourself some little scope for improvement if you are able to work on that you will be really giving a much much better performance on that day any specific question if you have in mind after question has been asked Mr ticket of communication skill is good communicate your ideas that is another good quality in you before take anything logic for that ok 71 last question since 17 days are left so how many what is the preparation level of current affairs you have to brush current affairs lot of things like your acts also evidence act and all that we had some perfunctory knowledge but we expected more elaborate knowledge so that you are able to explain to us in so many words what is the what are the changes and whether it changes are thinking in the country that kind of old wine in new bottle is hardly any change it is end of the colonial area but it continues to be a colonial in nature that kind of again opinion based questions may be asked but before that you should prepare it is 347 features Evidence Act for changes have been made your CrPC what changes have been made IPC what changes and what is Genesis of IPC CrPC in all that from where historically from where these acts have come if you look at the British rather than you will find the Genesis you have to go back to the Meghalaya and all to find out the Genesis of it ok just prepare thirdly that's the current affairs is very important for a sociology or knowledge appears to be fine what about little questions but they are also you should be fully aware of the Indian sociological thinkers their contributions the practices the relevance in modern india to those things opinion based questions may be asked do you think that consideration is still prevalent in the country in modern india that kind of questions and go with a positive body language and
