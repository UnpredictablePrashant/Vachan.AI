habits in the middle class can you expand the term you Udan sir it's pure Desh Ka Aam Nagrik industry government has set a target of 5 trillion dollar GDP and the Indian economy is not reaching close to that so can you record what is the deadline which year we have to reach the target the target for 5 trillion economy is the 2027 so we are already in the 2024 so you feel that in next two years we can reach there in my opinion I see the present economy is around 3.4 to 3.6 billion dollars as we have also seen that we are currently there is a projection of growing growth rate of 7.6 % and with taking an inflation of rate of 5% we are growing at a nominal rate of 11% sir I think that the target of 5000 economy is well within a week PPP US dollar GDP we have already third largest economy in the world why we should target our GDP in terms of nominal dollar GDP why not to rely more on PPP best which one is better measure of production I hope you have heard about PPP best GDP Hyderabad purchasing power parity based method is more realistic value of GDP and we are already third largest in the world according to pptx best poverty in India has already reduced drastically to less than 11% can you tell us what are the constituents of multidimensional poverty index for the constituents of multi dimensional poverty index at 12 constituent answer other than the multidimensional index which has been used by there are two things which are more added it is the Maternity health and the other is the access to banking bank accounts answer it constituents is the health indicators second is the education somebody is not having access to sufficient food but there is a bank account open in the name of that person accountant to Indian version of employee will be considered what are not having access to sufficient food of good quality but his account is open in a bank account is open do you think this is a realistic measure of poverty just because an account has been open in his name this is also in realistic account because having access to food is one of the criteria but savings behind the motive of having a savings account is focusing more on that benefits are transferred having an access to a savings account it gives people will be released to access this benefits the government benefits which are provided by the government unemployment in India is a high according to many International standard according to our previous record also it is high still government does not appear to be bothered about this problem why do you think government is reproduce itself less on unemployment removal the unemployment rate is still high but however that have been initiated by the government to work upon this as that has been the first killing we have the skill India campaign we have also a vision of increasing our manufacturing capacity to 25% of the GDP is contribution that we are saying for last 10 years but nothing has happened our manufacturing share is still 15% said there is also I think with the advent of we have also seen that in today's time the major issue for less for more unemployment is just a skilling gap the demand answer the government has been working upon that as they have been various schemes like Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana and there is a skill India campaign and also are the scheme giving any result because all these things are happening for 10 years 10 years is good enough time to make an assessment of the performance there are various other assets also about this in the between we had also seen the covid-19 pandemic it had led to people excuse the government said I would feel that this we could not avoid the shocks like covid pandemic as it has also resulted in people moving from unorganised sector to back to agricultural and people research paper on Buddh soft power so what have you actually talked about in this paper what are the major takeaways mam in this paper we have basically focused on that the Buddhism is an important tool of a foreign policy for leveraging a relations both in our neighbourhood first and at the same time countries in our Southeast and East Asian countries we have seen that there have been various efforts by the government in leveraging Buddhism as a soft power tool as in recently we had seen by the funding the international Buddhist concentration and we had we had also organised the Buddhist submit Global Business Summit recently we are also focusing on direct diplomacy has recently we had said lyrics to Thailand also we are focusing on Restoration of the University of working on a comprehensive tool to leverage this Buddhism as a software tool as we have also seen at competitor China also making in making the same efforts in synchronising the Buddhism why do we say that somewhere Buddhism relevance in the present time what was the reason behind the population of Buddhism Buddhist population in India is less compared to other religions but we see this Buddhism religion flourishing in Southeast Asian countries and are also in our neighbours Buddhism as a philosophy or as a way of life it's very still relevant as we are seeing the Global we are facing Global crisis like climate change the philosophies and the message of Buddhist still very relevant and in the same time when we are saying geopolitical crisis like was happening Buddha's message of non violence could lead to everlasting peace in this poem that what are the various social problems that West Bengal is currently going through and what are the steps you would suggest for tackling those problems social problem social problems which I can think of number 1 is a migration crisis contributes the second largest migration population to other states and the second year also seen that the education hub the West Bengal used to be it has gone down at same time the literacy rate were also seen that above 80 age of 80 population it is high but in the lower edges it's very low and in the health indicators we have seen that in the health indicators we have seen that West Bengal is not feeling well and we are also seen recently in one of the reports in the child marriage date is one of the highest in West Bengal major social problem that's the problem of human trafficking major problems which I can see at the problem of child marriage in human trafficking what are the concrete steps being taken by the government and what measure would you suggest problem there have been waste efforts by the government site in covering these resources one of them for the for the child marriage to stop child marriage there has been there is a scheme by the state government is kanyashree prakalp when they provide social scholarship assistance so that when girl child gets promoted or passed the various levels of different levels of education they get a financial assistance at the same time it also helps in delaying the marriage age and promoting a women empowerment at the national level we have the Beti Bachao beti padhao schemes and there are also what about human trafficking trafficking the state government and the central government has been working on this border zones Areas where the human trafficking is happening at a large scale persisting so suggest me one concrete measure which you would like to take up I think the major reasons for tracking is poverty and at the same time lack of awareness and also women not getting access to this education and health facilities if this can all be provided at the same time awareness could also be facilitated I think women will be more empowerment would be more empowered and this issues of human trafficking could be controlled OK Google you have mentioned that you got you secure rank 16 year NDA examination services and other similar services that you have opted as a service preference share and gone through the manual of the UPSC medical standards and at also talked to few of the service officers that told me that this anomaly is not the medical precisely the medical prescriptions or standards that have been prescribed for the two services one for the Defence Services and other for police services are a little bit more relaxed can you please Discover some of the rational behind this I mean I mean the prescriptions or standards are very stranger in terms of physical well being the how your internal organs are functioning in so far as Indian Army Navy or Airforce is concern but that is not the case with Central armed police forces and the rational behind having relaxations in the police services I think as the Indian Army is at the forefront of the border areas and we cannot afford to have any any recognised in our security issues however in police services police has the interaction in day to day life I feel that with a little bit less restrictions on medical Grounds they are still able to function effectively what to know about flat foot and knock knee disability is this permanent or temporary disability it can be overcome the flat foot and also ground for medical and I am not aware about how does it affect the efficiency of a person as a good solution you

appointed as the ad hoc judge only recently Supreme Court issue with Regar how the election commissioners of India will be appointed can you please throw some light on how recently the two election commissioners have been appointed after the supreme court directive about the appointment of judges the the legislature in the Parliament has enacted a law according to which the election commissioners are appointed by A committee which gives his recommendation the president the committee is consists of the Prime Minister the leader of opposition and one minister which has nominated by the by the cabinet can you please tell me we have in few States the system of you know having a bike camera legislation which effectively means the lower house will be Legislative Assembly Legislative Council how the members of Legislative Council are appointed how they are elected the members of Legislative councils are there in directly elected as we have seen that there have been representation by various sections there are members were also nominated by the Governor were also seen that there have been nominated by the various bodies like teachers you please give a breakup of I mean if the house consists of 250 members how what will be the what will be the composition from different segments so is that I can't recall at this ok my last question to you we are going for poles right can

result on account of account of a list of corruption go directly to Supreme Court or he will be required to go to Supreme Court via High Court from high court by high court supreme court has the original jurisdiction with regard to entertainment of election petition and it is going through High Court doesn't have yes it has got the appellate jurisdiction in that case thank you sir seminar on Indo Nepal relations problems and prospects that's not discuss problems let's discuss prospects so tell me what are some steps that can be taken to faster trust and engage in constructive dialogue with Nepal so I can think of the following steps number one to have a constructive and a Prosperous relationship we need to from p2p price we need to move to B2B price as the economy of Nepal is sustaining at a very we have a weak economy so if the investment flow from the Indian side to the Nepali side it would be beneficial for the economy the second there is an electron in the timely completion of projects we have seen projects like Mahakali TT which has gone for so long so if there are timely completion of projects it would be beneficial for both the countries and we can also have a trial Airtel Corporation in the development of HDFC in the Japan Japan is also contributing or investing lot in Bangladesh it is helping in their economic development the same could be also leveraged here in Nepal what is roti and beti ka relationship between India and Nepal is that as we share a very good cultural and economic Bond which are bounded by the ties of marriage and kinship this is also known as Roti capital due to open borders people marriage in both the sides we have cultural and marriage relationships in both sides what is the religious connect between the two countries and both of the countries have Hinduism as a majority population and it also acts as an good will both countries have lot of Hindu pilgrimage sites and we also see that this circuit thank

paper on role of business of power first of all discussion on the concept of soft power itself of the Other types of powers and all that so you should be fully aware of that and the rule of Buddhism factual question about the Buddhist council and all that factual questions were not aware whereas we thought probably will be able to explain many places in your dad not only this India Nepal relationship also Lumbini is that time is there attitude in the context of that is one thing which is very important then you have worked in NGOs also they are getting funded what are the conditions restrictions imposed by the government respect to the foreign funding and all that and what are they have been working in the NGO in which you have worked is was devoted to what Sustainable Tourism investment area so I have also healing of Himalayas that only so sustainable development goals should be very clear about those when those goals were set up what was the larger Idea behind this how many sdgs are there whether we have achieved in SDG or not what are the targets all those things must be particularly sustainable development or something I am not very clear about it but you are coming from Darjeeling we try to ask you questions and expect questions about the issue of why it was created what were the issues are relevant relevant if not relevant what has changed if it still relevant and why another registration is not Tak place the way that happened a few years ago and all that and how transformation from Gorkha land Hill Council to your Gorkhaland territorial administration that is another issue which and why it is autonomous or semi autonomous what is the meaning of autonomous what is the meaning of semi autonomous and all that train and all that we have asked questions chicken neck is another important are why it is called chicken what is strategic importance relationship with our neighbours particularly in relation to China and all that restaurant of political science also relationship areas like development of brick and all that beautiful there in the marriage is a man made natural Reservoir or man made Reservoir what the government has been trying to attract the to attract tourism that area how can you as a district collector or district magistrate contribute to its development in general and asked questions about JNU and all that is

worked and cultural differences in the life of an army man and his Williams and try to give answers to the maintaining episode don't try to give answer based on conservation of attempted at one or two places which you should not have you didn't have idea honestly said I don't know but on the original restriction part initially the High Court and Supreme Court while explaining it you said Supreme

care of that otherwise you are a good candidate and whatever you have just not told you this work on that to improve if you have any specific questions
