Vidisha tell me this controversy around the capital of Andhra Pradesh now what is the status today is settled on a still controversy is there after creation of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh has it rip benefit for Andhra Pradesh the state organisation that actually happened Pakistan if Pakistan disintegrates into smaller States will it benefit of India start situation in its neighbourhood so what do you understand by two friends equation yes coming good afternoon please introduce yourself to the board say my name is bhanushree I am 22 years old I am native of West Godavari district of Andhra Pradesh I have completed my graduation from Lady Shri Ram College for women Delhi University thereafter recently I have secured state first rank in APPSC Group 1 examination and currently undergoing training as Deputy Collector since last one and half months which place controversy around capital of Andhra Pradesh now what is the status of controversy is there yes it's not yet finalized capital because after the judgement of High Court of Andhra Pradesh the bill which was introduced for the proposal of three capitals has been withdrawn and the government is under the process to introduce the bill against the problem why why why why why should there be three capitals in a state like Andhra Pradesh opportunity to build capital from scratch so it has also includes development should be one priority of state having been used to capitals event during 1950 we lost after verification of AP and now we have lost Hyderabad activities at one place again if we have but the main reason is increased development to develop all the areas along the state on the similar lines question answers should Andhra Pradesh go with three capitals one at Amravati another at Vizag and third capital would be more prudent are there in multiple reasons first I would say if we have this three capitals are three different places it would that create procedural difficulties financial if we take a company which want to establish in industry it need to travel a lot to get the permissions and secondly initiation of building of capital at Amravati has been started around the 33000 lakh acres were pulled voluntarily given by farmers in order to develop the state and also 10000 already system is voluntarily gave their land without any objections because there is a that if they surrendered some sort of land again after redeveloping the capital they would get in return the land if not the same extent are the value would be same with the developer facilities of all infrastructure and give you two cases one cases of Nirbhaya you must have heard about the case of guilty were convicted after years another case if you remember was in Hyderabad which method is better giving instant justice or going through the role of judicial process is a student must not be increased at any cost of following the due process of law increase the trust in the criminal justice system in the people as well Kashyap who was related to the tax credit status even after years of maintaining like expending expansion on him still are system followed the due process of law and convicted him according to the rule of law of tell me and you have spent some time in the government tell me what are the problems a Lady officer faces at the workplace in a government sector problem in having gender parity in administration I had heard about instances where people are people usually not if not look down they don't respect security issues of the protections available to Lady officers in a government department exclusive for government department I am not available but there is a welfare protection of women at workplaces it would there are some provisions of internal complaints committee and not after creation of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh has it rip benefit for Andhra Pradesh the state organisation that actually happened verification but there are some Areas where I would say it had given a new opportunity for a novel status Andhra Pradesh long coastline which was given entirely to Andhra Pradesh and this coastline can be its 974 km second largest and entire area it can be used for the development of Andhra releasing the blue economy and also and also developing a state from scratch with all the includes development IDE new opportunity which is given to US states what happened to Telangana then I think invalid had benefited more than Anderson because the Hyderabad which is the hub of development it used to contribute around 30% of combined state revenues and all the IT activities have been concentrated in Hyderabad so regarding the revenue sources with Telangana has been benefited both are tobacco producing state one of the leading I would say tobacco producing state in fact Andhra Pradesh has after Gujarat has surpassed almost all the states in production of tobacco what do you think production of tobacco is justified keeping in mind the health parameters such even the cost of the state of the health of the people of health of the ordinary people why is it good economics what is that usually tobacco production happens in is going to restrictions and also the farmers there are cultivated tobacco since ages so there has been practiced of cultivating tobacco so they are not aware of all they are ever of the ill effects of tobacco they don't have any alternative skills to develop other crops I would say decreasing the production of tobacco alongside killing the farmers in producing other crops would be a beneficial option like even now there is a proposition of increasing millet production that area would be suitable production recently seen some cases of naxalism in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh why there is still a presence of naxalism in the states what is the reason years congregated efforts have taken place but still naxalism is present in Andhra Pradesh which have happened recently on a whole level then acceleration is on decline in Andhra Pradesh but these periods are do raised concerns I would see the firstly still there is a development deficit which these stable are surfaces and also the feeling of alienation and relative deprivation of analysis which were being taken by state would also develop sort of insecurity and along with this accountancy measures that should be development of the tribal district which would increase the surrender and Rehabilitation policy my last question to you that how would you improve let's say tomorrow you have been made a part of an advisory panel advice report to the Government of Andhra as a prominent position and young brokerage are always encouraged my question to use how would you advise the Andhra Pradesh government to boost up the ease of doing business in Andhra on what parameters 54 steps for five steps to start Andhra Pradesh has been topping ease of doing business in slash for 5 years firstly I would say reducing the red tapism digitalization of permissions which need to be taken by industry should be a student options and secondly I would also encouraging production linked in sentence as well and also said earlier there is also disturb being taken there is one single window clearance for all the permissions which were being asked by the industries model that the world is talking about which is the termed as unique and also second is rythu Bharosa Kendra Aslam recently delegation from Nigeria visited this model fried Bharosa cameras to emulate the same in their country ok how has been the economy of Andhra Pradesh since Andhra Pradesh has been separated into a different state has economy economy been doing well going with the stats given by the budget the physical fiscal deficit was around the 3.5% which is acceptable by frbm but still remember practical ground because the loss of revenue due to the loss of Hyderabad as well and also in the capital expenditure it is just 16% of our total there is a positive side of the economy because there is lot of coastline and blue economy being realised and also investment being recently Global investors Summit was also held in Vizag tell me by when will India become superpower I can't define a certain period as such but I definitely see in near term future if not superpower it will it would be a great farmer ok do women in India have a quality women in India are in the process of achievement they do have equality man but still there are some Areas where the opportunities are being that in my personal experience I had seen this gender in our village there are agricultural labourers from both men and women I in front of my eyes fitness the women labourers agricultural Laboratories compared to many even though they do the same work at home will it benefit India in my view I don't think so much because if With Benefits I said partitions into smaller district there would be other sentiments which would rise in India as well mam for example the Palestine movement and all and also my stability in neighbourhood ISKCON essential for India security Mein if it gets disintegrated there will be certain security concerns as well as busy on social media always social media is setting unrealistic beauty standards also specially for females of your age what do you think about it it stands for creating a feeling of insecurity and the same time there is this empowerment of women happen in this social media for example everyone is beautiful hashtag so I think it depends on the individual who get on the maturity of the individual one should be enough to look into the first two side of the social media last question to use I want to know who is your favourite man in this way why despite having face many difficulties since childhood he never allowed any difficulty to be in front of me and he always supported me every time at every low point we have been talking about Andhra in Telangana of water which is polavaram project because it was concerned with the level of water which is being stored in polavaram is fixed at Higher level IT the backwaters would intended Bhadrachalam which is a part of Telangana map currently there is no such solution which is earthworm because AP on its side is constantly putting forward its argument that we have studied all the possible ill effects of the project and there is no possibility of such incident which was decided by bachawat criminal around 1977 it is in the ratio of 7770 to 30 mm now is demanding 50 to 50 ratio should avoid the percentage of water to be here we can't involved in that it is still under process scenario of global warming that we are at right now these water disputes are going to get dirty you know that so what else can be the various solutions apart from that should be used that have been set up for water sharing the rivers are going to have National stores in the coming years what can be the other solutions to this problem I feel this linking of rats because polavaram is also project for linking the river where the surplus water from Godavari can be shifted to the Krishna linking of flowers would be one solution and also regarding solving the dispute as such these projects must be transferred to river management was rather than keeping it under the control of state the level of rainwater harvesting and agricultural level think of water conservation techniques such as the inner paddy cultivation there is a concept of writing and drawing of Spider-Man alternative that would reduce the use of water student of political science there is a concept of nation state and state Nation can you tell me what exactly these two things mean and where does India stand Nation state is an entity where state is referred to the political form of entertainment it is more associated with the boundaries and the area but nation is a feeling where the people are binded together so I feel India is called as national state which state nations are where the nationalistic feeling led to the formation of statement for instance its European relation with many states but I am not recalling the example of no problem can you tell me the latest mission to moon that has been undertaken by us and what has been its result and how could India achieve the soft landing I am unable to recall the USA's Mission India had sent Chandrayaan 3 month to the South Pole and was successful in learning in South Pole at the first country in lining of rover on the surface of moon map and the instrument will come out of that and experiment situation between India and China border and India and Pakistan border those two friends food can be an instance of having at one time so what should India do to avoid this situation of face this situation solving this border disputes between both the countries although there is this argument of no talks with terror with Pakistan after Nawaz Sharif government openly declared that we are willing to talk after the election should complete so Nawaz Sharif would be one solution because materialised the land which integrates Pakistan and China territory for the jio Paradise India's border security WhatsApp that has been in use a lot these days it is anarcho capitalism so it has been a news and what exactly it means recently there have been allegations on India that India has been taking some head jobs in countries such as Canada and US for India is response to the Canadian allegation and the US allegations have been different why show because the cooperation with us is now at most important for India as a second year would also thinks the evidence like Canada then submit the concrete evidence which is required for the case what you understand by the living tree view of India's constitution is also open enough to accommodate those changes by amendments flying Jatt context the concept of basic structure comes in now this is school of thought with the basic structure Doctrine has actually not allowed Indian constitution to evolve with the spirit of the times how far do you think this criticism is validity I don't think it has immediate the evolution of constitution because if we see the features which are pronounced under this basic structure Doctrine these are certain concrete features which can be encourage the answer for instance free and fair elections and also federalism these are the four principles of constitution and these must be added the hindrance evolution of India's constitution has been popular in social media that is Boxing you come from my final question to you is what is the significance of article 371d unable to recall what about the special status that has been given to various States as Andhra Pradesh also got a special status provision in the constitution did not get the special status and States but it did get the special package which was announced by the central government which included certain economic benefits to the state answer currently this special status of states has been removed by the Indian government all the benefits which were under the special status still continuing the categorisation of special status has been given Andhra Pradesh telangana changing some places including Andhra Pradesh rivers diary is a new trend as a marriage dynamics change societal and economic changes what is your take on this dowry any economic extraction based on question would not be a welcome status for male or beats for female if there are any economic gifts which are given voluntarily they can be produced but dowry as such based on squares of manner would not be a positive theoretical explanation you are giving the legal and ethical practice not getting enough they are not getting in my personal experience I didn't encounter any such case thank you very much when is your interview experience already joined government service as Deputy Collector so you should expect some questions regarding your area of work I don't I didn't ask the question what exactly as Deputy Collector you are doing where are you posted by the way you are already in the district what are the areas in which all the areas which are coming under the jurisdiction of state you must have been associated with all the areas I am just department and the second is village secretary department and what as Deputy Collector you think what is lacking which you think you can you can really plug that is one thing and rural development will lead you also to the Panchayati Raj Institutions empowerment of women and all that that is very important do you think that this Panchayati Raj institutions have really empowered women if if not what more is required and what do you mean by women empowerment giving just financial Independence is it enough to empower women or what are other issues and concept of Glass ceiling and discussion is second area which is very important state what are the parameters of sunshine state and all that because afterwards you have to really know your work and then you are a female officer the protections available to female houses that is important the issue of RTI somebody may ask questions regarding RTI how many RTI cases do you get what is RTI act you think it is being misused by your own people locally for their personal benefit and all that you have worked in Delhi he has studied in Delhi or from Hyderabad to How do you see the difference in the life of female Hyderabad what are the similarity what are the dissimilarity that kind of factual questions very surprising that we have written you are not mention the name of your college I was unable to edit that in the form try to rectify this mistake I just email the UPSC but there was no reply to defend there because you are not able to write this how do you think that you can handle situation stressful situation when you become district magistrate maintain your school admit will come to definitely this is one area where you have to really give Political Science and international studies International I think you have to be very very horror in that because you have interest also International we ask to certain questions I think go back and read that those concepts and all that all concepts are important and try to be an opinion based questions try to give any responses very short answers Godavari issue we have discussed and all that the rice bowl of India so what are the disadvantages of containing with paddy cultivation and all that that is also in the focus to read all that you think that paddy cultivation should be stopped and should be replaced by some other type of cultivation agriculture being a Business models are there and all that and inclusive development in Amravati in financial area and social area these are the general questions we can think of and large are wonderful candidate and excellent candidate and we don't think you will be getting marks which is less than 175 also it may fall in the range of 135 to 19195 also just then change your personal integrity do you have any specific question your mind to ask my place holding post of Deputy Collector you should give a very confident polythene is while giving long answers it will come to your mind that is becoming too long there you have to take a pause and then ok
