what do you mean by carbon trading Gurukul Kangri was founded what is the outcome of the recently concluded WTO ministerial meeting one is Centurion motion another is no confidence motion can you please distinguish between the two India is also trying to put up its own constellation for the GPS kind of system what is its importance for India security good morning sir good morning please give a brief say my name is Gaurav Singhal I belong to Bharatpur City Rajasthan arrived done my graduation in electronics and communication engineering in 2014 from Gurukul Kangri University Haridwar was that I joined CSIR Council of scientific Industrial Research as a research fellow and there are also enrolled in the phd program for doing my PhD practical work for 3 years for ISRO exam and join the scientist in 2018 and similarly for the Engineering services examination I got selected in 2018 answer I joined the Railway services in 2019 in my services and preparing for civil services administrative Reform taken out by the Indian Railways basically it was done to reduce the department is what are your personal views is it a good idea or a bad idea to have a one unified service automatically it organised services into one sir in my view is the intention is good however we should give some time because of the Indian Railway services that technical in nature and since the irms is being taken through the civil services and there will be candidates coming from the owners arts or commerce background so they may not be compatible or the comfortable enough to do the technical works like the signal in the Engineering Works therefore we should need to create one comprehensive curriculum apart from its or it should be run on pilot basis of the idea of the government services its a progressive idea more thought or the more time has to be given for this year tell me where does the electrification of Broadcast stand today sorry sorry I could not understand electrification of Broad gauge tracks where do we stand today for it has been around 87% of Indian Railway broadcaster what is the target for 100% achievement as per National rail plan by 2030 we need to do the 100% electrification what is the Railway electrification benefits for electric electrification of Indian Railways benefits are in many ways first of all sir it reduces the carbon footprint which is produced using the diesel locomotive secretary of imports from the foreign countries and thirdly sir the direction of the electrical because they are compatible with the electrical units for example Vande Bharat trains in this they provide what do you mean by carbon trading carbon trading is a way by which excess carbon or excess carbon reduction by any company can be traded to offset the to other company which have not been able to reduce the carbon footprints without concept of perform achieve and trade discount given by the government to the industries like heavy industries like thermal power plants their carbon footprints if they are able to perform within that limit so they can or if they are able to perform more than the limits they can trade that and can have the monetary benefit talking of the carbon trading the two types of markets one is your voluntary market and another is regulatory are you aware of the differences in the basic concepts of these two in the context of carbon trading or emission trading about this monetary parcel I would like to check about no no issues what is national what mission send National smart grid mission targets to install the smart grid or it is target to replace the existing a great with the smart grid so as to increase the plant load factor of plant availability availability factor and to make the load dispatch load dispatching efficiently sir what is suryoday Yojana recently it has been launched to provide rooftop solar plants on the households or 1 crore household will be covered and the subsequent to install 1 kilowatt hour 2 kilowatt hour and the subsidy for 3 Kilowatt is 78000 does it cover the cost of installation also sorry does not cover around sir 50 to 60 % what happens to the remaining amount the remaining amount either households have to spend by their pockets or they may have some interest free loan service in the context of cardboard trading for this video is very much relevant first of all set to achieve our targets of renewable energy and to generate 50% over installed capacity by the non fossil fuels for the Paris delete cell and secondly sir it will increase the it will increase the electrical availability of it will reduce the energy poverty which had been a major factor of regression in Indian economy and apart from its it will also generate the employment opportunity or income opportunity said it allows the households to give it back or to trade in market access or surplus generated renewable energy for the surplus energy generated through the energy scheme is plot back into the grid system first of all we need to install net metering net metering is such that if we are consuming the there will be consumption then we have to pay and if we are generating access to the same excess energy can be fed back to the grid net meeting language takes into account the generation what is the our installed capacity and what we are generating if our generation is more than the installed capacity sir it will offset or it will give us the calculation that negative this much amount of negative behave and so there will be obtained in your bills are thank you very much thank you sir Gurukul Kangri was founded sir it was founded in 1902 by Swami shraddhanand so when it was founded that was the year 1902 that entirely different situations from today's find any changes in the aims and objectives of Gurukul Kangri which was in 1902 and now this is almost 2024 in 1902 it was founded by the Swami shraddhanand Ji to propagate the idea of Arya Samaj as well as the spiritual learning B.Sc in the technical education admin imparted rubber Engineering College was founded in 2010 and other streams like the BSc or MSc and PhD in the engineering Sciences also is being provided for the apart from spiritual education like the Gurukul system is also existing there also imparting the technical education Gurukul or it is just confined to the male students should make the part of this it is the demand from the of the UGC or higher Educational Institutes also and the background goes to the Arya Samaj original Foundation was not for the both male and female Amritsar in my opinion in the present age circumstances at least for the technical field for gender should be allowed ok you are doing PHD or you have already completed PSG sir I have completed my you have complete that's very good what was the topic for my topic was remote sensing and drones usage spectral imagery to find out the crop by physical parameter and sir I also used machine learning to find innovative when we talk about this national education policy regarding development of research and innovation do you have any idea about that research and development portion has been given greater emphasis in the newspaper are there has been talk of increasing the expenditure as a government GDP how far is it has been only 5.7 % of GDP so we need to take it around the world Savage 2.5 % of GDP secondly there has to be the industrial and the educational institution collaboration so that the students who are doing their master of PhD can get the exposure to the industries and thirdly there has been some not able to recall but they have been some changes regarding the assessment of the higher education history of USA then after civil war that was posted in 60 in 1 year 30000 patients what is about India what is the present status of India how many patterns we get in one year the latest one Sar as per the reports BR at the 40th position of the 112 in the IP index hours are the patents position is not good enough I am able to recall the patent status of CSIR around only 1000 8000 been able to file sir there are some loopholes there are some problems in our Indian Patent Regime system the first problem sir which I also observed is that of sir it is very common some procedure at least it takes two and half years to file and grand the patents and secondary have been the victim of a less R&D expenditure we have not been able to expand more on the R&D as against the like the developed countries the brain drain has been a situation sir in the India due to high employment PSG on June and Remote Sensing now what is this Indrajaal sir Indrajaal is an anti Drone Drone technique has been recently developed by an Hyderabad waste technical company basically is there has been incidences of cross border Drone attacks particularly in Pakistan border will be able to first of all intercept them and to take the take the retaliatory actions against those who don't I am not able to sorry sorry then also there is one MQ 98 Drone what is this two best of my knowledge altitude and long endurance from my side that is again related to Drone what is Drone didi is the concept under self help group which was propounded by the our Prime Minister under this Drone the scheme the self help group women can purchase the drones at the subsidized rate and they can rent it to other farmers they can carry out some analysis of their fields like the pesticide of term given by our Prime Minister so that empowerment what is the outcome of the recently concluded WTO ministerial meeting recently outcomes of WTO meetings was first of all are there has been discussions on imposing Moratorium On The E-Commerce transactions WhatsApp no confusion there no concrete conclusion apart from each other there have been discussions on the fisheries subsidies and grains subset is also again in their have been no concrete conclusion like it will be continued or what will be the options before the developing countries and sir I am not exactly sure words are there was some discussions also about the appointment of appointment dispute redressal Commission Government of India had pressed for having a resolution on public stock holding of food grains what happened about it I will have to what exactly is public stock holding and why it is done public stock holding the two best of my knowledge will refer to stock of food grains with the public itself so that they can sell it at the attention of point or they can use the benchmarks of buffer stocks FCI is holding our buffer stocks the figure is exactly surrounded known to me sir I would like to check about them ok Government of India has recently also negotiated and agreement with EFT a what exactly EFT stand for European free trade Commission free trade agreements are recently government has finalized EFT with four of the European countries like lanchester in Switzerland and other two countries are there and condition which government of India put forth is that they will have to invest 100 billion dollars into Indian economy and there will be reduction of trade barriers from both sides so that the more inflow of goods and services you know that large number of Indians and also many foreign nationals and citizens keep their fund in Swiss banks Swiss accounts if it's Switzerland commits to invest 100 billion dollar in India most likely that will be round tripping of Indian money only Indian money kept in Swiss bank and that money is invested back in India so why government is making tall claims about it and why did not transparent about it what amount of fund Indians have kept in Swiss bank has a government asked for the data exact figures are I would like to check how much fund is reserved in the Swiss Bank hours or government and times are asked to reveal the data and it has revealed some of the data is evident that there has been lack of transparency while keeping the funds in the Swiss banks therefore efforts and my opinion has to be taken out to reduce or to abolish the transparency to a non transparency and bring the transparency so that the and we can leverage or we can take benefit of this efta so that we can come out with some transparent methods so if let's say we are attracting Swiss fund in India that will be actually dirty money coming to India and that will be create more dirt in the system if you want to have a fair and transparent economy we should be targeting the white money and clean money rather than 31 you think this kind of agreement is productive in the wrong Limited knowledge I can say that the money will be coming from Switzerland is not mandatory that it will be the black money since the Government of India has signed the agreement and it will not be in favour of doing transactions in black money are you aware of this phrase round tripping a fund yes sir what is that parking the surplus funds are the some benefits to sell companies in other countries and then order the investing back to the origin country of companies registered in foreign territories invest India that is classified as foreign investment yes sir it is classified as it is called the phenomenon of round tripping and what is best and profit shifting what is that again sir this is a part of the non transparency funding in this set the profit less profit is shown in the origin country because it is shown in other country so basically we have to over the origin country has to pay less taxes to the to which country what's the difference between efta and EU stand for European trade agreement and that is associated Association European Union it is in it is a group of 27 countries of the European Union they have the common currency and they have the economic Union with some members of EFT are also members of you EFT members are not members of ok thank you thank you Gaurav ji I was just going through your service preference you are already in group A service can you please tell me why you have not opted for if you group A services and you have given preference to some group B services also there is not enough set pattern while you are preparing for good services you have opted for Danish and Danish but not given any preference to Pondicherry and Pandit set of services are similar in nature to a great extent why the reason to include some of the group A services and group B services I have been associated with three questions like CSIR ISRO and then this working experience in multiple departments and have instilled me a sense of diversity that I would like to work in some organisation which will provide me diversity the preferences field they were based on my Limited knowledge and the guidance about them on the Internet and whatever sir I felt that the I did not fill them because I just want to be a part of any service within the RAM of civil services I would like to go into the service which will be best fitted for my skills and experience they will provide me some sort of a diversity I will be able to work with you have not update me opportunity to serve in Delhi as well as Andaman and Nicobar so you don't cons Pondicherry is part of India do not undertaking to serve anywhere in the country right it is not the things that I do consider Pondicherry how much these dynamics and dynamics sorry this will be more favorable or more suitable for me ok can you please tell me three states in North East namely Arunachal Nagaland and Manipur they have a history of Armed Forces Special Powers Act 1958 only recently the tenure for imposition of this particular act has been extended for another 6 months can you please tell me which Agencies have been interested with the mandate to declare what constitutes disturb area for the purpose of this particular Act 1958 the central government ministry of home affairs is entitled Central Government State Government to have the power to declare an area as OK what are the powers given to the armed forces when this act is in operation in a particular area sir while operating under this act in the disturb area sir they have the unbridled power of Caesar and arrest and other power the Section 4 of it gives that they can shoot person if they consider that it will be against the national security or the it will be against the peace or it will bring the disturbance of peace and they will shoot medical termination of pregnancy act of 1971 is almost you know every year is a news for one of the other reason for the simple reason that are approaching High Court of Supreme Court for getting certain kind of relaxation can you please tell me under what circumstances the medical termination can be pregnancy can be done within 22 245 in this particular can you recall something from there to best of my knowledge if I can recall from 20 to 24 weeks the minors who have been victims of rape or the ladies for the women who have their marital status have been changed that these criteria service can you please tell me there are two ways to ensure you know accountability of the Government of the day in Parliament to two mainly one is Centurion motion another is no confidence motion can you please distinguish between the two motion is passed through the government does not necessarily have to resigns no confidence motion if it is passed that the government of the day has two reasons thank you as someone Walked in ISRO the two priority is for the nation in upcoming times are a man mission in space in the second one is setting up our own Space Station what is going to be the importance of these two things for India these two missions are very ambitious missions and with respect capability to launch the main space mission in the mind mission in the space sir first of all the it will increase our research and development in the outer space programs but we will be able to launch it is correlated with our International Space stations because the International Space Station it has to be made all the time we will be able to deploy our manpower into the internet some of the challenges associated with it took us so much time to reach to this particular point although India is in a moderately decent I mean place as far as space research is concerned so why this is so challenging this has been challenging because the first of all the we need cryogenic engines to launch the main missions for the International Space Station in the past sir there have been some collaborations with the Russia how were they have not been very much beautiful therefore India developed this in house capability of manufacturing cryogenic engines so that took time and apart from itself there have been many tests like we need to make cryogenic engine as a human rating apart from its the launcher for the satellite they will have to move back to the earth at show that these type of things takes time and sensor behave tested all of them successfully and we will be able to launch right India is also trying to put up its own constellation for the GPS kind of system what is its importance for India security from security perspective India has launched irnss as a group for the constellation of seven satellites sir it provides the 10 M of accuracy GPS like accuracy in the Indian region as well as 10 M accuracy to our military services it will be used for the surveillance mechanism or to provide the rescue of the intelligence information to our military and security agencies are recently India has notified CA right can you there is lots of debates around it can you give us some specific suggestion to make kind of much acceptable law when this is so much debated do you have any suggestion about it CA provides citizenship to some of the minorities are coming from the Pakistan Bangladesh and Afghanistan so how was the bone of contention in my opinion has been there has been lack of awareness and lack of communication between the government and the people so sir miss information has been one of the cost and their have been there had been bite product information about a public information in the public domain would be a good idea so that it will increase the acceptability of citizenship Amendment Act in the Indian population playing badminton do you follow some of the developments in the badminton are in around the world Chotila Samudra recent developments sir recently French open tournament is going on recently it has been concluded and from Indian sites are our badminton Doubles team has won the gold medal or it has won the final match and sir in men's single lectures in has been able to enter into semi final and the good thing about things that he has been reached to 16th position in the world from 19 position and he will be able to enter into the Olympics and thirdly Indian women PV Sindhu our player has not been able to win the quarter finals right my last question recently NSSO has released the household consumption expenditure data and everyone from research AC technician to policy makers we are looking into this data in kind of finding so many things very interesting and very important how this data can be used for better policy making sir recently concluded household consumption expenditure provides us about the about the changing needs and the change in direct directory consumption of a one Indian population both in rural and urban areas that prediction of this groups of the this gives indications about the needs of the society the schemes like Pradhan Mantri Gramin Yojana or the national national food scheme for they can be they can be rationalized and the food grain types like if we are giving only rice wheat or service household consumption also tells that what could be done like that we need we can heavy mix basket of other food grains or other pulse like things and secondly it also tells us that there has been increased in the expenditure in both rural and urban areas so it tells advice thank you must have studied Indian space policy 2023 I must be aware of the key features of tell me about this policy has transition of ISRO Indian space policy 2023 basically clearly outlines the role of ISRO non government entities or department of space as well as respect is such as the outer space Exploration for core Research Development apart from its are the work of commercial work of the ISRO it will be given to Commercial arm like New Space India Limited and to make a greater interface between the startups and the academia and the ISRO facilities are the in space the work of any space has been clearly outlines are also encourages participation of private place giving freedom to security of our country feel that they are more involved in the commercial exploration like launching the satellites for the communication purposes for agriculture and disaster management purposes and for land record monetization for this type of activities can be outsourced to the private sector security related issues are there being tackled the space agency as well as the department of space agency they are involved in the security related space activities one last question before I let you go what is Indian Railways green track sir green tracks are the one near by the tracks are solar power solar installations will be done and also said the apart from doing the Solar installation it will run with the electric field engines and since there is one component of tree plantation second interview 2287 what was your score in the personality of 165 by such a low marks my opinion all went well but the conversation with Chairman sir was not conversation with the chairman what happened they ask me about my PhD and he asked me that how did you manage your PhD with your ISRO and then preparing for that what you doing seriously I told him that from 2015 to 18.0 any preparation I solely devoted my time to PHD after completion of my practical work only I joined the ISRO and then prepared for BSC and CSE was not special time we have spent with you are not supposed to be getting 165 capital of getting 180 plus any statue all the qualities of becoming and I don't know it take it as one of those bad days that's what I can tell you but you have a very good very matured candidate for the civil services head on your shoulder very balanced opinion you have tried to give and your general awareness on variety of issues I prepared problem try to at least remember those things and there is I believe there is some your don't Amendment Act also after the key features of the act and all that updated your knowledge is ok what is Heron and all that update your information collaboration with Israel and all that you should be aware the second thing is that you are interviewed on 28 April day of happiness also prepares this why India's ranking is low on what parameters is happiness is measured and all that somebody who is interested by additional information you have opted for engineering as a paper very experience of working in the ISRO and then doing PHD is true then Railway some questions will be if you ask me largely questions will be confined to those areas only on a product of your climate change or transition from fossil fuel to renewable sources of energy issues like National hydrogen mission bouquet of all this related to your field of activity and then issues like your what you mean by energy efficiency of the country is going to achieve the energy efficiency in smart grid we ask you about this target and all that electric vehicles is another electronics so many issues and then issues like you are just energy transition partnership you must be aware that also and what is Energy Independence what is Energy security these are general physician which are another is there in the field of snt Smt means signal plus telecommunication so what are innovations taken in the field of signalling in the Indian Railways a particular to avoid accidents in the region you must be aware so you will able to handle that about the Kavach scheme why why we have been only hearing for the ages about the covers uski why it is not getting implemented and all that can you think of any better scheme corridor is also coming up what is the signalling Technology involved in that ask you why it is different from the technology which you are using in the Indian Railways what are the reason for that that is talking about the Telecom part of it your relationship that is Indian relationship with railtel versus importance space is another area because they have worked to space policy and you are fully aware and all I don't think there is much advised to be given to you happy to be fully prepared on variety of issue read your Rajasthan also authority you could ask any questions or Rajasthan so new districts have been carved in Rajasthan why do you think is smaller districts are better person arguments to support to support that otherwise issues can be anything but you the way you tackle those issues I don't think your purpose is there in your arguments and appear to be episode critical power of assimilation also all those clear logical logical express your exposition very good qualities so just take it as one of those bad days while he could 165 by itself is not a per marks but person like you who is capable of touching even 200 if he gets 165 and Apple something must have also wrong somewhere this time I think good marks so how have you done in the means compared to the last last time should be your name should be there if you have any questions to ask one question regarding WhatsApp why did not that was the first question we discussed about service Railway download update for irms as because you are already there is a technical service but what is the national behind opting for a group B service first of all this has to be understood by you very clearly secondly if at all you have so much of interest in working in general areas in the Civil administration of police administration field why not Pondicherry also why Delhi only but what you said there could not be a better answer then be honest in your words don't try to cook any story of fabrication whatever has happened narrate it fully because ultimate it is your choice if something is offered to you whether you join or not and that as because this choice was offered to be with my little Limited knowledge and all that wisdom and my command I thought probability this will and why Pondicherry sir I thought for any service at least I will Spending My Time between Andaman Nicobar and Delhi that kind of thing be honest don't don't fabricate the moment you start fabricating they'll be problem I don't think that the people sitting this side will not be able to know your love if I told you want honesty is very important for any prospective service servant maintain your honesty and whatever has happened whatever has made
