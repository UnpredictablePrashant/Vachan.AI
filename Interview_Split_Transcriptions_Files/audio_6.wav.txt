doctor wanting to become a Civil Servant how do justified the contribution of Dhanvantari first would you know about him and what was his major contributions the field of medicine you are a doctor so while writing prescription RX what is the meaning of that could you please tell me what is the reason of having this particular extremism present in cultural area what are the key reasons behind this farmers suicide mechanism good morning good morning thank you please give a brief introduction about yourself I am Dr Ankit Jadhav currently I am working as a medical officer in Primary Health Care Centre Gurgaon I have completed my graduation from BJ medical college Pune doctor wanting to become a Civil Servant how do you justified holidays of my college life had inclination towards civil services but concrete decision to join civil services was taken during covid-19 pandemic at the time I was working as internet doctor and I thought that my decisions would impact a larger population affected our life is diversification first of all it has made a conscious about our health secondly we also thought life lessons like crisis management and also we got to know the importance of life and personal relationships in Microsoft what do you mean by promotive Health Care or preventive Health Care as far as I can remember is active interventions to do in the Healthcare sector to prevent the advent of diseases and to have more Healthy lifestyle what is the patient doctor ratio in our country and what is the prescribed ratio by the World Health Organisation by who the standard ratio should be 1:17 doctor patient ratio for the exact ratio in our country is a revolves around 1000 CM want to largely go to the rural areas of the population rural population in rural area as well I have seen that doctors have fancy Expectations of urban life and they don't want to get that is the primary reason and also the infrastructure inadequate testis we have in Google Healthcare settings problems in the rural Healthcare sector apart from infrastructure issues are there is the inadequacy of paramedical staff and also there is kind of interference from local governance bodies as well in the working independent working of doctors and there is a lack of compliance from patients as well this is I think show that doctors are attracted to go and stay in the rural areas of the people around experience in this regard is concerned I think that the public service motive and ethical training regarding this ethical value training of sacrifice should be given from right from the first year of Medical Science in today's eraser I think doctors are more motivated by the corporation and profit motive this feeling of doctor should be removed from their Minds and if we still the spirit of public service right from their first year of MBBS I think more and more doctors will be joining rural services analytical practice of your Nexus between the corporate big Pharma Companies and the doctors the Nexus is that the pharma company is given to the doctors to sell the branded medicines and they do not prescribe generic medicines for the purpose and also for some doctors also asked to the unscrupulous practice of Giving more test and Reliance on clinical practice has been trying to ensure promotion of generic medicine Pradhanmantri government is implied under the scheme they have stores for generic medicines and in this way they are promoting and insurance model successful in my experience it is quite successful and the but we have to EN missing middle population missing middle class that is not covered in the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana should have alternative kind of model for them what do you mean by hypocritical Earth is a place that we subscribe at the time of our graduation to in the so that the doctor should invite certain values and he has he should have Public Service that is not the country has been very good pioneer of medicine in India and I think we should have our own place instead of exactly why it is not happening I do not know the answer but I think it should be the what should be there in our practice Ankit Ankit aur what is the pronunciation of your name one thing recently news cropped UP regarding the logo of the medicine association and where the IMEI also registered the protest that logo what was the controversy as far as I remember regarding this controversial the logo is Greek god or something the I am a logo and it was been placed that it should be replaced with Dhanvantari aspiration the current location of Dhanvantari first would you know about him and what was his contribution of medicine Limited knowledge in this record Dhanvantari is a godly figure in Ayurvedic medicine and it is a source of inspiration for ayurvedic practitioners and they think that the intuition knowledge that Ayurvedic practitioners have regarding medicines is a is come from Dhanvantari God Dhanvantari was a minister and also a physician in the court of which ruler of something about the concept of Ayurved mention just now which is the earliest text from where we get the information regarding Ayurvedic distance between these three value the earliest text information regarding Ayurveda which is the text the book for where we get the information regarding Ayurved I think that's right so tell us something about atharvved what was the information do we have from other person Ayurvedic also contains other charms and magic spells and also other contains other practices of other tribes in the in that period so do you think that those practices are continued in some system of medicine even current time in India also we have about various practices from Ayurved itself and modern medicine has many ayurvedic drugs as well as such as pin it is what is antihypertensive drugs it has Origins in Ayurveda and also sir Sutra therapy that is also practiced in modern Medical College personal check personal is called as father of medicine and why there is a controversy and shut up and Dhanvantari who should be called the father of medicine Sadak or Dhanvantari I think sir in my view charak Sanhita that is the text is a very comprehensive and very knowledgeable text even for the today's scenario and even today we do not know about and there is adequate research regarding this so I think in my view should be called as father of something about a very renowned and send his instruments are even used today instruments invented by instruments like cutting and also for dissecting fields that instrument instrument model names I don't know question to you is this sense of working in a rural areas and as a medical officer you must have face many challenges but what the challenges is also to communicate with the people of those areas because supposed to give the medical prescription in English the hardly understand that how do you actually write the prescriptions actually I write prescription in English Sir but I explain in my mother tongue that is Marathi to them and I explain them that you should follow regularly so come to write in Hindi and understand that you should take this medicine for two times a day but the exact name I write in English because the pharmacist or other if the if he goes to the other clinician He must be knowing it's a doctor prescription RX what is the meaning of that actually the practice originated in the Greek practices and its kind of religious significance specific meaning of that word exactly the meaning of what do you understand by antimicrobial resistance and why it has emerged as one of the biggest threat to mankind antimicrobial resistance stands for the those antibiotics which were effective earlier are not responding to the and bacteria have become resistant to it that is the case and the reasons for antibiotic resistance are that today doctors are prescribed some other doctors and also the mainstream doctors prescribing more antibiotics in the fields that are not in the common cold or viral due to lack of awareness also like what is called otc drugs over the counter drugs how it is being regulated to control over the counter drugs in the field of mental drugs and mental only those drugs like sedatives and hypnotics are stringently regulated but the antibiotics have not that stringently regulators ok which is the new covid variant that is spreading these days currently J and 1 variant is spreading and it is from which lineage it is from the omicron Linux while the patients treat in the patients sometimes a principal is followed which is called price what is tries is following emergency medicine services for that purpose we have to categorise patient into three categories it is red green and yellow and in that purpose the green red patients require immediate attention and other patients and black colour and more than patients that cannot be solved are categorised that and some patients which do not require a major attention in other colour was it being used also during the covid-19 severe wave second wave In theoretical perspective it is not applicable in a covid certificate was used because we had huge crunch of resources at the time and we were running out of so India is referred to as third world's pharmacy but in recent times we have been getting a bad name because of some incidents that have happened where Indian made medicines have led to death of children what are these cases are where they have taken place in Gambia in Africa sir we have cases and also in Central Asian countries with Afghanistan death of children what is the chemical what was the toxic element that was formed in medicine but it might have been changed into other toxic exactly that I am not so what should you do have a stringent regulation regarding this export control authority should have controls regarding this and also domestically you should have good regulation for this purpose and what is vaccine Maitri I know about vaccine is a vaccine diplomacy where we as we have good production capability of vaccines we should we give vaccines to the leading country it is said about who that it is an organisation which knows everything but does not think in that context sir I will say that who is knowledge but to do nothing is not I think covid-19 because directives and the criticism responded early who is the Director General of WTO Palestine issue so what is India's stand on Israel Palestine issue and should India change its support to Israel currently sir India has continued his historical stance that is two state solution for his head and Palestine and I think sir as India has been balancing a diplomatic type of there that we have strategic interest in Middle East and Arab countries as well as we have security implications with israel's so this time should be continued but incoming times it will be very hard for India to balance distance you are coming from Maharashtra Maharashtra is one of the developed state but still happen to see left wing extremism in Gadchiroli after being so developed could you please tell me what is the reason of having this particular extremism present in cultural area is the regions of gadchi and also there is a lack of development in that case but the while comparing the numbers we can see that there is 90% reduction of lifting extremism due to government efforts in recent times but the infrastructure errors and we have not currently reaching out to this communities that might be the factors that still continue with the reason for left wing extremism that is there in Maharashtra is it the same reason that is there in the Northern India or the same some other reason some other aspect is that the same reason as far as I can see there is mining in this and there is an excess between the next slides and mining of years is a contemporary term used to the people sir we have which have sympathy for this nationalism and they promote extreme left wing ideology living as a other means other people like us ok now since you are coming from Maharashtra there has been a popular sentimental demand since from the reorganization of the state and of course recognition of the Marathi identity now I read my question to you is that why is still after so many years Marathi was not recognised as a classical language is quite world as we can see from the documents but I think the government should consider in this regard and should give Marathi a classical what is your opinion what is the reason that why Marathi till now has not been given the status of a classical language we are inadequate in this regard we should make too much efforts to convey the government that this is a classical language and strong historical roots ok also because you are a doctor and happened to see that most of the newspaper report point out that today we're seeing frequent heart attacks I could you please tell me the reason that why so much of heart attacks are happening in India especially the heart attacks at the very early age sir the life style is a first and foremost in this regard sir stress levels have increased also the food habits and director habits have changed dramatically people are eating more and more fast foods and also the surveillance infrastructure is also increasing sir we are knowing that the people has the reason for one of the Jyotirlingas out of 12 which one is there is also one of the district which is sort of in famous for farmers suicide what are the key reasons be farmers suicide as far as I can listen first thing is the length fermentation that is has been happening since last 22:30 years so people are not getting enough returns due to that and another is the rainfall nature of agriculture in English on the figures of monsoon people depend and farmers depend and also as far as I am from farming communities as far as I can see the prices and price realisation has not increased as such in 2000 per quintal rate to the soybean and in current times also there is 4500 what about the death trap of the farmers there is a lack of formal credit availability and people rely more and more on shops and money lenders private money lenders right what is the rate at Which crop loan is available to the farmers can I listen to 30% and maximally 30 what I am talking about that what is the rate that the government charges or the banks charges for the crop loans these are very subsidized kind of 6% per annum it is 7 but 4% is submission by the government right now you are also a doctor right what is National Pharmaceutical pricing authority and what are its mandates the National Pharmaceutical pricing authority is decided rates and it's also has regulatory mandatory regarding compulsory licensing and you have also done some debating related to will AI replace human beings so will I replace human beings in my opinion in coming to 5 years the repetitive intellectual jobs which requires a kind of data analysis will definitely be replaced by a but the jobs requiring complex National skills soft skills will not be replaced by so will the job of doctors we replaced by AI in certain areas like a radiology and in ophthalmology we can have more AI coming but the emergency medicine and those required soft skills will not be replaced in my view right recently we have seen that there is tendency that lots of investors from external sector foreign investors they are increasing their stake in Indian hospitals right why this is happening as far as my knowledge in this regard is considered it is might be due to the medical tourism that is happening in your country and people are coming from all over the world due to affordable and affordable cost to be provided so it might be due to that the booming health care centre you have been writing please in Marathi what makes Maratha Marathi distinct from other part of literature say Hindi literature I have read about Hindi and English literature but what qualities that I found can you differentiate between the two different special about Marathi Marathi literature is more Revolutionary it has a kind of voice for dalits and download sections of society it's also has some realistic notions that depicts the situation is very things I can find out as compared to Mental Health Care issue is become very significant issue in our country 2017 Act was also passed and three and four features of this amended act Asar after this amendment mental health has been in for front of policy of health before that sir mental health was not at that considered as important as that also it has improved focus on students also the working professionals and this kind of more focus from right from the Primary Health Care setup to the tertiary Health Care setup about mental health in this section and any amendment relating to the suicide there has been proposal for that decriminalization of society use of electron convention machines and all that exact provision regarding ECG machine last question Expectations especially when your face with drug constraints Yes sir it is extremely challenging as far as my experience in this regard is considered most of the times if there is a lack of drug shortage in government set up then we have to consider the patient that you should take this drug from private sector and I should say to them that you should have list expensive drug that is generic drugs ok thank you very much nice talking to you thank you thank you 19 is this interaction with this it was speaking to fast time if you take a pause RTO performance related person very humble humble polite person and you try to speak to the best of your abilities and never ever you entered into the area by gas works so and whatever information you have knowledge you have you tried to convey to us in clear communication people in your area of studies and the perspective Healthcare system in our country whether is area of focus so Healthcare issues what are the problems in the urban areas what are the issues in the rural areas private sector Healthcare your public sector Healthcare What are the differences between the two sectors and all that particular year working the rural area to get 456 points important to find the answers should come naturally to you because it is also speaks of your own personal experience of spending time in rural areas and what kind of problems you have faced apart from the critical problems as a doctor in what is your working so what exactly that should be done which has not been done which if you are go to go administrative site where are you may be able to help the people there in getting access to the basic medical needs then one question you should not try to very very self operated on anything when we ask you about the hypocritical Earth and all that and final exhibition go for the Indian modification of you should go or not you went a step ahead saying that ok that is what I am saying other is also when you are confronted with such kind of situation don't try to be judgemental SBI Balance that is another thing in your voice of Maharashtra Maharashtra Maharashtra border issues just have a look at that some questions may be asked in ancient text text of Indian Medicine questions National Pharmaceutical pricing agency so if you know what exactly this agency does no problem if you don't know what about this but I don't know what is related to pricing and camping of Rates of drugs and all that type of questions what are you know if you don't know politely say I don't know guessing and then drawing ok RX I think as a medical resting any doctor before writing names of medicine rights RX is a Latin word ok meaning about the countries where it has happened but what exactly was there in the cough syrup composition digital who is the present context on other important area is development of this green corridor for smooth passage of ambulance transplant and all that one such corridor has been tried in the country what is the importance of such corridors and all that as doctor what do you feel what should be done about it and mental health care is emerging area and the Government of the day is concerned about this area also related area issue because so many questions Nexus and all that organ business transplant and all that some questions may be asked if you should be able to answer to those questions apart from all these general issues Maharashtra specific your current affairs what is happening in the country around the country so what kind of questions will be asked nobody can guarantee you but the way you answer questions and wherever you don't know if you have any specification of tension
