according to you what is one biggest problem of Uttar Pradesh why in India the medicines are given by the shopkeepers without even looking into the prescriptions so where was the last World Cup played so what does the absolute number indicates so as a student of geography and maybe aspirant of civil services what is your take on it means introduce yourself to the board so my name is Rehan Singh how to Unnao district of Uttar Pradesh from there itself as schooling through Saint Lawrence School Sir after that I have moved to Ram this college University of Delhi from their graduated via maths Honours mathematics Honours sir aap graduated in 2020 and after that have been preparing for civil services examinations sir I am also a state level football player answer my hobbies include tactical analysis of football games and also I like watching documentary related to natural disasters tell me that you have done your graduation in maths opted for geography optional paper for UPSC the basic reason was because there is a part in mathematics called pure mathematics sir it is more based on theoretical part sir I was not good in that so that's why I decided to choose a Geography answer it is also covering a lot of syllabus for mains also for that very what was the reason why I have just OK good you are from the state of Uttar Pradesh according to you what is one biggest problem of Uttar Pradesh which is not been able to tide over right now I think the women's the crime the safety and security of women sir is one big issue that is happening in Uttar Pradesh answer recently also the ncrb data report has also highlighted this that the Convection rates are increasing although but the crimes are also there to a larger extent political dispensation of Uttar Pradesh claims that have been able to establish the rule of law cases are happening sir it has improved to a larger extent but sir still the mentality of people because it is larger rural area and sir because of that there is a lot of illiteracy in the states apart from that the patriarchy and cast and communal related issues are also there and women are the women face such issues primarily sir because of that so I think that is one big reason Sir but state has been improving to a larger extent also but do you think that Police in the state of Uttar Pradesh has not been playing the role which is expected after sir I would back to the first on the statement so because there is there are lot of schemes that the UP UP state government has been introducing sir there is this scheme that they have been introducing set apart from that we have also move towards zero tolerance policy answer this is I think creating a lot of deterrence among the criminal sir student of Geography dependent on rainfall for 5% of agriculture requirements that can you suggest to read this kind of situation open rainfall that is Cruiser about 50% is population is dependent upon rainfall so so that for that Service I think the watershed development should be one criteria that needs to be improved sir secondly I think the recent steps by the Prime Minister that catch there in wherever it falls whenever it falls so that is also one big step so then I think importing technology from Israel sir because we have a good relationship with them answer they are what is case Nation and still there efficiency is very high for that reason that I think these steps can be taken what are the Technologies we should drop from some Technology such as cloud seeding using various iodides and sodium crystals so there are doing it very good apart from that the watershed development so that I mentioned so that they are doing extremely well and they are also creating drinking water from the Mediterranean see that is situated campaign is basically sir lot of modernization in technology such a sprinkler and serve you are also using the traditional techniques such as bamboo irrigations are also so these are I think some few steps that we can take what to buy ethanol blending sir ethanol blending basically means addition of Ethanol into the the common fuel fossil fuels that we use oil products by that should be reduced the amount of renewable energy reduce the emissions the greenhouse gas emissions that helps in controlling air pollution sir it reduces the large amount of green has Greenhouse gas emissions that that is being done by the fossil fuels does it help the farmers can you please repeat the questions I think climate change is one big issue and because of that sir water stress and rainfall change is also happening so that's why there is a big issue because of that answer we introduce these techniques for the amount of the food security protection of sugarcane and corns that can be implemented and because of that food diversification can occur by that I think allight can you one thing that why in India the medicines are given by the shopkeepers without even looking into the prescriptions sir I think this happens because of lack of regulation in that sector sir primarily we are short for the doctors and the prescription based medicines that needs to be given so that is not given right now Sir over the counter drugs are being provided so that I think is one big issue for that reason so tell us the process and cons of this particular practice Sir right now I just read about this report that the antimicrobial resistance has increased to a larger extent that is because of increased intake of antibiotics I think this is one of the cone that we are facing right now sir I think so there are various generics that I think the Pharmaceutical Pharmaceutical people are very much aware about that so I think so easy availability and quick giving of these medicines is one such areas are that can be one processor and what is the role of the pharmacist in this entire business so the role of pharmacist is to maintain the quality quantity and ensure that the availability of medicine is ensured in the hospitals and also said as you mentioned sir that availability of drugs over the counter so that is also one big issue one availability so what happened in the time of covid-19 medicines which were considered to be life saving medicines out of the market and black marketing was going on from the door step the pharmacist only so why technical is happening sir I think that happened because of this reason called profit sharing and because of holding the medicines and because of that the prices are located that may be one such big issues are what is evergreening sir evergreening of patents basically mean that we bring slight changes into the site changes into the medicines and so because of that extra years are provided by the patent office by that I think evergreening happens what do you think what is the solution to stop such kind of practices sir India in its Indian Patent Act of 1970 sir it totally reject this evergreening of patents are apart from that there are various regulations and trips also service tends to stop this medicines which are used by the footballers or any athlete to enhance the performance sir I'm not sure about the exact medicine but there are various medicines which improve the stamina recently also I heard about this news that various inhalers are being taken by footballers who are suffering from asthma so that is any performance augmenting medicine for exact medicine thank you like to do the tactical analysis so where was the last World Cup played so it was played in Qatar and between which two countries final year so final was played between France and Argentina if you have to briefly analyse the game what actually happened in that game so in that game France played with the formation of 433 and so they were playing attacking football whereas the Argentina they were more on the defensive side and striking France and counter attacking games so that was the basic part of the game Argentina was winning easily but everything change in the last 10 minutes of the regular time and after that it was very good contest between the two sides and it seems like maybe France might have The Upper Hand it was a fair fixed sir I would umbrella angry with the statement sir I do not think there were any fixing charges that were made by FIFA also said there were some claims about it on the social media itself but I do not think so there were any charges Ok why was the Australian the Argentina goalkeeper he was censored after the event sorry was sensitive because of some gestures that he made with the trophy that eventually I do not think anyone player if taken out from the team will result in the defeat or ok so what do you understand by this polar vortex recently observed in the poles sir it is basically the revolving winds in the upper atmosphere sir because of that if it shifts southward the cold storm the cold storm happened the USA and also sir it is also one of the reason why Ozone hole is widening sir ok now in Delhi we are experiencing very severe cold right so according to IMDb when do they declare a cold day what is the range of the exact range how much should the temperature drop in a day somewhere that includes approximately 15 degree celsius is the limit and below that 5 degree Celsius If temperature decreases for a certain amount of days then the cold wave energy aims to be carbon neutral by 2017 and what is the target taken by China is taken 2016 as a target relations then India in the conflict between Israel and Hamas has taken a stand which seems to be facing Israel but now on due to israel's retaliation and it is disproportionate retaliation for 20000 palestinians have been killed and many of them are actually innocent women and children so should India be considered a support for Israel sir I back to defer on the statements or according to me sir my stands India stands as that it supports are two state solution and which is in favour of Palestine also sir according to according to the recent reports or India has highlighted these issues at the highest forum at the United Nations also for all those we currently pursue a special interest that we have in the in the Israel Israel and also in the girl region that's where we are trying to keep our policy with respect to state solution what is our have you heard about the definition definition what is the meaning of definition means that relationship of one country does are relationship with one country does not depend upon its Enemies sir that I think is the definition ok final question to you English said to be a Net security provider in the Indian Ocean region so what exactly is not security provider the Net security provider that India currently aims to be is that it wants to ensure that no piracy events happen apart from that sir the growing growing role of China in the in the region is also counted by India was initiatives such as diamond necklace policy that we have sir we also try to ensure that various nations which are not on the same path growing status like as such as Maldives the necklace of diamond policy of Government of India figures but it is sir according to diamond necklace policy what it is it is trying to counter the string of pearls policy that China is trying to create a what are these like my question is are the stated policies of China and India sir I am not sure about that it is official language you are talking about ncrb data you said that ncrb data indicates that the crime in Uttar Pradesh has increased against women is it so the conviction rate is not increased the absolute number did increase but crime rates what does the absolute number indicates when the when there is the high rise in the number it shows the crime is reduced to the crime registered what is what is the NCERT significance the increase in these numbers is because of the increase of the crime sir I can we can say that but sir to the largest extended the increase of registration has happened because of that crime has a positive is negative I believe it is quite positive in nature that means the cases are registered sir ok now who collect this particular data ncrb data so the report crime in India sir I am not sure about who collected ok now Uttar Pradesh also is a news because of Ram Mandir my question what is have you seen the architectural significance of that particular Temple that is being constructed there artificial significance of that temple on what is style it is being constructed it is based on Nagara style of architecture similar to which temple in India similarity I am not an issue you are of course in volunteer under clean Ganga mission plan 1 and after that Ganga action plan to was not able to eat some good results for Ganga the status of Ganga more or less is very much same now a new innovative step that is Namami Gange has been launched by the government now according to you what is the present status of Ganga humbly like to disagree on the statement so the status of Ganga has largely increased the cpcb report that was in 2011 so it highlighted that Ganga in 2011 was not even be able let alone for the fecal coliform that are there and apart from that high biological oxygen demand oxygen sir recently while while introducing Namami Gange 2.2 sir it highlighted that Ganga Resort oxygen has increased and biological oxygen demand has also reduced but there are certain stitches over which the impurity happens so one such stress near Kanpur also there is a lot of pollution and apart from that for Varanasi statue what is the maximum position that is inducing such large level of pollution in Ganga after which substance it is highly pollutant it is largely domestic sewage and ternary that are located on the banks are you sure about that it is the domestic sewage or it is the industrial sewage domestic fire use a long words now what is the budget of Namami Gange project sir today it is 23000 crore approximately 23000 crore ok now you are talking about security of women What is mission Shakti Sar mission Shakti has been introduced by the UP Government sir they are creating various techniques and who are trying to empower the Empire the women that are there and they are also trying to train them apart from that volunteering a volunteering is also happening in this particular screenshot can you tell us something about geography of Delhi Peculiar about geography of Delhi that is contributing to its pollution during those winter days in winter is very high so it is because largely of the paddy that we burn in the nearby areas sir apart from that the traffic that is there which is created by a heavy vehicles so that is also considered one of the greatest pollutants in daily life about Peculiar topography of Delhi sir it has some part of Aravali is inverted ball shape famous quotation by late Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee that you can change your friend but you cannot change your neighbours as a student of geography and maybe aspirant of civil services what is your take on it is very much we can not we can never change your name is for that very reason Pakistan and China sir two of the most hostile Nations that we have so we have to keep a good relationship with them so constantly seen that over the LOC and lac numerous incursions have been made by both are both the state States sir so that very reason sir there is good amount of opportunity for us to in order to create good relation so because they are non negotiable and we have to share the borders always with them right tell us a few geographical endowments that India has that makes it a kind of advantage over other Nations so first that I can think of is its location we have a very strategic location bound by the Indian Ocean having about 7500 km long see boundary so then we have a large amount of agricultural land also Sir but the issue is that we do not efficient we do not have efficiency with that agricultural land survey compare that with China they have comparatively very less land for agriculture but they have high very high amount of yield and efficiency with your student of mathematics what is Fibonacci extension sir Fibonacci series can I some mentioned sir it goes like one then we add another one it becomes to 1 + 1 then it becomes 3 what is use where it is being used you are doing some tactical analysis also so in lots of tactical analysis this series is being used can you tell us a few sir I am not read about it I will read some application of Game Theory during the tactical analysis of football match or a football series can I take an example for example if we have a penalty shoot out there is a goalkeeper and their and there is an opponent player so so now there are two players in this game so when is the one is the player sir we have different outcomes in this situation so for example if the player decides that if the taking penalty taking player decides that he is going on the right so then the goalkeeper had seen the video of it sir he would think that I won't go he would go that said I will divide that side but then his decision is also dependent then the penalty takers decision is also take also taken because of that goalkeeper also so what I mean sir the place intentions depend upon other players intentions right by last question to you is that recently up has surpassed Tamil Nadu to become the second largest economy of India as a chief secretary of your state what will be your top three priorities to make sure that up I mean reaches to the pole position as far as economy is concerned chief secretary firstly I will focus on infrastructure of up sir Although we are doing very well in that sector 3 cities are they are largely being uncuts focus upon the artisans product that we have recently I have read this about this news that we have the highest export in terms of the one district one product scheme Sir but it is not not widely popularized in domestic spaces so that I will do so in order to create more economically good revenues so thirdly I would try to these are the truth what is that it was started from Allahabad and it was a private Cruise which catered tourism it started from Allahabad and it ended in via Bangladesh attended in Assam that Cruise passes through Bihar and of liquor prohibition is also basic essence is also retained so Bihar is a dry state so for that reason sir it is very important to ensure that the state governments combine they coordinated in this particular scenario so if I have a position sir I would try to co-ordinate with those higher authorities and ask them to not not make them available when we when when the cruise enters into the Bihar state and also try not to outflux that a liquid in through that villages which is happening in other states in the dry state so I think to enjoy by Cruise why should we are deprived fundamental right of drinking as because I believe rule of law should be the primary aim that we as a Civil Servant should get sir because there is a rule that is prohibiting that particular thing and in I think we should cater to that you don't suggest any amendment to the existing room sir I will look into itself thank you very much thank you so much thank you so much of Ninja would have been proved on the situation answers at the last also that I have noticed that we can improve balance communication skill and you guess the song variety of issues and mostly your answer is very good certain things you have to very remember very clearly at whenever such type of question is asked which is very difficult to answer the very first question what is the biggest problem of UP is such a general question is very difficult for want to digest this question but you don't have any control over the questions you get that kind of questions quickly have to think what should I say where I do not get into any travel initially you said something is not like that so that should not happen once you have said that this is the problem and later on you start defending that uniform so you must be uniform in your approach whatever line of argument you have taken if you have taken a wrong line of argument immediately able to understand and Express say sorry for that ok but after few discussions and few countries statement you should not be changing your ok that is one take away from this interview is better to take up any social issue that is social issue will always be a problem actually I was having two or three issues but I want to bring one that's what I call it presence of interview is all about that are going to be handling affairs of a district tomorrow to understand a problem and if you are able to handle this kind of situation you will get 19200 any problem factual questions so can be anything you don't know you are from up up as we have mentioned that it is on the trajectory is going up so whatever Good Works have been done by the state government just make a note of that good schemes initiated by the state government by the central government professional particularly in the area of financial inclusion social links and infrastructure also you said innovations and all that is going to attract foreign investment which area it has been able to Garden the maximum points then your International Airport is coming up in Jaipur what is the model of that airport infrastructure but so I had some schemes but sir is it right to mention those initially said about infrastructure very very crisp in your answers whatever is ask you should be answering that only you should not be displaying your knowledge beyond that you have to understand yourself that is also important ok so I was coming to that so what is the model of that Jewar airport how many Agencies are involved why it is called a special purpose vehicle why it is getting developed on PPP lines that kind of thing so this one such examples how many bridging the gap between the Western side of it and Eastern side effects of bifurcation typical general questions you should be able to answer those things Sky background to different speaks of your mind that you can also think differently but that different thinking should be very positive function ok it should not have any negative connotations so your views where large balanced and appear to be a very energetic person communication skill is wonderful very positive body language so all those and we really enjoyed interacting with you that is what is important because on the other interviews are given for this was one issue that I was speaking so fast very difficult to pass a judgement on that every person has his own style of speaking so you have your own unique style say that you are very faster you should stop what happens if you try to work on that let the ideas flow freely and as far as possible right as I said that tried to be very very focused OK so the moment you are to the point you have understood the intent of the question focus your response around that ok ok when you know something more on that just wait a patient wait for the contribution will definitely be asked then all the good qualities and you will be getting good marks also in the process if you have any specific question feel free otherwise be confident be happy go with a positive body language smile on face thank you
