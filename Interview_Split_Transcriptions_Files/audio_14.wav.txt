very often we hear about the Gujarat model of development have ever heard of this model how would you rate the present government in terms of foreign policy what has been the biggest challenge of your life some of these lines in kuno palpur where now the cheetahs are residing why was this proposal not taken up seriously by the Gujarat government gift City fine what is the idea behind this gift City good morning sir good morning good morning please visited please give a brief introduction about yourself I am born and brought up in Ahmedabad Gujarat have completed my graduation in chemical engineering from Vishwakarma Government Engineering College so you are basically from Bihar if I am not mistaken generally found in North Bihar result Uttar Pradesh but we are residing in Ahmedabad Gujarat from almost 45 years per month model of development is a transition if we compare from 2003 to the development that is happened in 2011 240 answer it is about economic development and also the development in the education with respect to the investment that has come in Gujarat and also the different kind of sectors that are now growing especially the startup culture that is overall given a boost to economic productivity of Gujarat do you think that this model has been quite successful in the country we are able to see a influx of the FDI as well and also the economic growth is Getting higher and as per the estimations of the IMF almost the estimated 6% growth so it is a quite good model which is reflected will what is the flip side of this model what is the negative side of this model the Environment Degradation it is taken place and replicate the same of Gujarat in Gujarati investment are more in economic sector but we are liking behind in the health in the education sector mint or not much in that you have studied public administration fully aware about the provisions of RTI so what are the broad contours of RTI act about the provisions of the democracy which is basically to provide the information and to bridge the asymmetric city of the information present it has a clause of having a pio officer based in the offices to provide the information based on the filing of the artist in India transparency and also empower the citizens with the information symmetricity people say that often misused by the citizens you agree with this statement instances of the same but overall sir it has empowered the citizens in misuses of the same can you give us one example by which you can prove that yes it can be used it is found that people do ask about the person lives of the officials and all and they also can we are also inquiring about the personal integrity of the working which are sometime confidential also as per the loss and public administration effectively address corruption in India recently some traders have demanded the very recent Diamond City that have been built that the alcohol Ban must be lifted in particular in that particular area so what is your opinion because of course it is considered that Gujarat is a dry state so I would like to ask your opinion what is your stand on this why it is why people are demanding that alcohol must be served or maybe the ban which is there must be lifted area is demand has been raising and some of the government is also accepted the demand like it's not fully into the policy right now but in the newspaper they are covering that the government is accepted the reason for this is that they are saying that people are investing from the foreign countries and there are also some cases where the foreigners are also visiting the place so for the economic development and for boost especially because alcohol is not easily available in the whole Gujarat it will be the economic area of that is one of the reason it's a writing that regulation is machined with freedom of choice of the individual in fact people are prevented from even you can say having alcohol what is the reason what are the anomalies in that what benefit that the government is getting because ultimately it is also depriving its revenue from it is the government definitely is Losing on a new on the other side the health indicators in the domestic violence cases all this has shown a positive remarks that this is reduced especially in Gujarat and if we talk about the areas where the national crime record Bureau data domestic violence cases have reduced in Gujarat not because of we can't generalize about the alcohol cases but because of alcohol the impact has been positive that they have reduced it might be that the cases are rising but they are because of other aspects as well sir ok you are a student of public administration between Elton Mayo and Mary Park of Foley who is your favourite singer very unique kind of theory like the cow socialism with he introduced that was a kind of social and the psychological motivation to put up the all the things that means of course is focusing upon human relation what about the psychological aspects of relationship between the employees now suppose you are a bureaucrat and you are posted somewhere in may be in some of your some of the backward states now my question to you is there are of course the society is very much differently segregated there are society is like North Eastern society is the North Eastern states who are advocating for material now there are of course psychological barriers especially when it comes to women now how what kind of impact the present context of thinker the classical thinkers especially held in my own their aspects can be utilised in the in terms of lifting the psychological barriers in the society talked about the efficiency and also about mental Revolution especially if we talk about Taylor Swift mental Revolution can be only suppressing the women in the society by whatever the thoughts of the psychological aspects are there is not something that can make the share of the by a large we have to integrate damage well into the system so that the sharing of the pipe will increase and all will benefit ok so you believe that classical thinkers can also be relevant at times in the broccoli or it has lost the relevance in particular context when it comes to upliftment of women as a society or replacement of the status of women such that their building blocks of the all the behavioral things and all if we talk about the administration the aspects of hierarchy and discipline these are still needed in the Bureaucracy last question how would you rate the present in terms of foreign policy out of 5 how would you rate the present government in in context of foreign policy of the government should I would say that they are doing better about that is your opinion I would like to ask your opinion what what you may have some parameters what is your perspective of the foreign policy today are we going in the right direction or we are going in the wrong direction I think we are going into the right direction because we are focusing now on the real foreign policy and we are not going into idealism the second is that we are also having National interest at the very first and we are also focusing on strategic economy stand in the Global forums as well I believe that our phone policy is not going very right do you have China you have how relationship between China is going you have a neighbour called Pakistan you also have a neighbour called Maldives you also have a neighbour like Bhutan who used to be so I believe that foreign policy is not going in the right Direction What is your stand we have at the prior of the above foreign policy the neighbourhood first policy as well so we are doing lot of effort for the same in each and every sector but it is also that this country is our neighbouring countries are not ready to corporate on certain issues which our external foreign minister has also highlighted time and again it is the lack of cooperation from their side of your life today if I talk I can't think of the life today nvc Gujarati Businessman ruling the country what is the unique about Gujarati that the end up making good Businessman the culture of Gujarat is like of a business kind of I would say that in the air in everywhere if we talk if we go in the school there is a certain kind of business mind being promoted and after the 12th especially people choose to get into some family business is especially and if they are pursuing the higher education level to something that is going to make make them ready for the business especially like a person is having textile factory of his own then he will going to MBA to promote it more but at the same time we see Gujarati women are not taking up business or work so much there are literate but not coming into mainstream employment why is that they are getting into the business aspects as well and they are more involved into the network business marketing strategies and making the things did you read about the recent update on current account deficit of the country what is current account deficit right now I am sorry I am not aware of the number increased it's alright I was reading in your dash that you want something in Karate Self defence policy for women of this Nation around Self defence will be given the education of the self defence especially I would prefer that both of the genders but if it is about it must be given the training from the school itself and there must be the inclusion of the women's into the self defence Self defence rules as well and we can promote this by inclusion of The Karate schools which are there by going into the schools colleges especially and for the women who are working and must be certain kind of training programs which should be mandatory as well by all the countries do you think there is something called judicial overreach is it happening or is just jarkan judicial overreach has been time in again coming into the news but I think that it is about providing the political alertness and also working on those sectors where the implementation is not done so it is about we can say allowing the system as well as sincere from Gujarat this year Navratri celebrations the 2023 because Navratri is a Gala event in Gujarat in the state however it was marked by a very sad news that around 10 deaths had happened in 24 hours because of non communicable diseases or heart attacks why do you think there has been this rise in non communicable disease especially in the states which are relatively economically doing better Gujarat fast food and that is rising day by day it is considered that if you eat fast food you are cool and you are very much healthy so this is a considerable thing over there I am not much about the condition but in Gujarat they are having a sedentary Lifestyle because the increasing per capita income and also the rich status of the society mam they have the made overall in the house moreover as like the women were force participation is also less so they are not having any physical activity as such and then over that there I can say that the culture of going outside in eating this is more highlighted and this is fine like some people do it to outside everyday this is also not consideration of this fact and has it done anything about it because it's a major role on India on its human resource as well as a country we have to look at the health aspect of the people has there been any movement animation any program with respect to non communicable disease movement which was been promoted for the non communicable disease and its highlighted that we should we have to cut on the translate the intake and we should limit it out and for that the regulations is also came to limited to around to 1% of Gujarat is also famous for its Gir lines ok can you tell me what is the status of the lines and what are the challenges if you continue to keep these lines isolated in one part of India the status of the lines for the latest survey class 677 in numbers and the numbers have increased in from the recent past if we talk about the isolation of the same I think when the geographical location is more suitable of Gujarat but it is very dangerous to keep them at one place isolated because the disease like can in disease is also found that and if then it can take a major tool on the Asiatic lions which are only isolated at one place there was a proposal to shift some of these lines in kuno palpur where now the cheetahs are residing why was this proposal not taken up seriously by the Gujarat government why was it not ready to part with its lines but I think one reason for the same like mam one can be the economic consideration That Give enjoy the Exclusive status of having the lions and if we take about the economy among the Girnar is one which is promoting tourism is coming together in tourism place they are going to visit the guidelines as well as things are in collaboration so I think that they might be not ready to ship this economic part of this thing what is continuing to drag despite major cause for ceasefire in the world I think it's something going along the lines of Russia Ukraine that is also not showing any signs of you know stopping in near future what is going to be the implication of these long drawn words on the world order and otherwise in general on the word implication for the same would be if you have to talk about India and implication will be the balancing of both the sides the Palestine in the Israel when the second is if we talk about the whole world is one the energy security will be in danger and the energy price of the same would increase providing that inflation would increase and the recession can again overtake after the covid-19 talk about anything of human life science that would happen environment all set for the Vibrant Gujarat Summit what is the relevance of the Summit for Gujarat as a particular and India in general Gujarati we talk say this Vibrant Gujarat Summit bring it takes a lot of industrialist and also commercial shares over the place and said there is a community kind of meat with lot of exchanges of the brushes in everything will go on and I see that there are a lot of also business deals that are happening it is going to bring economic prosperity in the Gujarat other thing is that they also promote the art and culture of Gujarat there so it is also getting tourism sector is also going to get the attraction from the Vibrant Gujarat Summit the same model in the India I think the other states can also strengthen more than on their strong points and then they can with highlighting such kind of summation fine Gujarat has recently came up with gift City fine what is the idea behind this gift City Idea behind the gift city is to make a business Central business Central centre of the whole India and this has to be the financial Centre whereby we are providing tax exemptions and exemptions from certain kind of security taxes and all Suit to promote the business over there and to come out with a Holistic economic models you are from Ahmedabad Sabarmati flows from your city is known for a very good clean up kind of exercise Sabarmati river front is a very famous tourist kind of destination how can the learnings of this clean up of Sabarmati can be useful for cleanup of Yamuna which is again very polluted river the Sabarmati model has been the benchmark now and then if you talk about the Yamuna the issues are different special with regard to the industrial waste that is coming into the river we have to consider an identified the problems their first and then provide a kind of model and make a strategy also to clean up and make the riverfront there is possible you are also from the land of Gandhi right what is the common connection between Gandhi soft power and Gandhi as a solution for all the ongoing Wars across the world what is the common connection between these three that the idea behind the war is someone something that if we do a lot of hoarding and we do not practice practice the non violence and the contentment in ourselves in the words and every thing will happen imperialism as well as the world right now are happening in for the land for the resources and so answer there is somewhere the vested interest also involved in this so if we move to the path of non violence and sells like using whatever resources we need to that can be the idea of my last question to you would be your hobby is as a coordinator of GTU take first flight is planned it is just about to take up in next 2 days and suddenly there is a news of cancellation of this event because of some unforeseen reasons what will be your response and what will be your action in such an event recently Science Congress has been terminated just a couple of days before so what will be your plan of action the participants and also apologize for the inconvenience that is caused and so it is it would be better if we provide a certain reason behind the same so that the convincing can be more powerful the other is that we have to also like whatever the resources we have planned for example the 10 told whatever the resources we have brought in for the Summit if you have to take care of that and we have to return them back and try to get maximum out of it so that economic losses are high speed rail corridor popularly known as bullet train is coming up in the country in Gujarat terminal from Ahmedabad to Mumbai in Ahmedabad acid in Mumbai at girls white is called high speed corridor or a bullet train say because of the speed that is provided in the cutting of the cost and especially the model which is designed of the same what is the speed at which it is plant to be to operate would have known it but I am not Statue of Unity is called the Statue of Unity is a symbolic for the Sardar Patel Sardar Patel and he is known to unify the India the princely states especially into the forming the unions what was his role in the next section of Junagadh princely state the son of the Junagadh king and thereby give he said that if he would not accept the offer then definitely because his father was no more so he gave a certain kind of counselling to him and then that was unanimously geographically speaking to have an ex Junagadh with Pakistan it would be not a good physically was it possible this is your first interview as well but it was not of that standard first interview for the Civil Services have you done in your means I was not sure about the selection I have written all the papers and completed them as well but still I can't say anything how was your experience with this I made a lot of land does a comment then I contact was not to all the members and I made very sharp context like when I was looking at your I just like your eye contact should be speaking to me talking to me but in between while giving answers not always all the time mechanical just know your when you're talking to me just 2 minutes ago we are looking very natural looking at everybody it should be very natural look it should not very mechanical kind of a look so but make sure some give some way behind the back of your mind so that number one it should look natural at the same time you catch attention of all Board members that is number one realise that you should have waited for the chairperson to ask you to set down details should be conducting yourself time regarding today is this thing you are good candidate or not about it quite young also a good candidate is a second attempt only you are coming from state of Gujarat which is a very vibrant state in many aspects so you should expect a lot of questions related to your state what kind of questions guarantee you are mind which may be covered may not be covered with try to cover some of them some other areas like your chemical engineer so we didn't ask questions on that I feel that I am not on the right track because of first I got to know that I have to do the deaf so I started to prepare my day was done I give the interview what that is like whatever I have done it is not good enough of the matching Centre then I started to do the default my time was already gone and then someone suggested me that you should do one of the institutes a book for chemical engineering I started that also because I was not supposed to be knowing much about the chemical that you have opted for public administration so it is presumed that your order after things and what is happening in the country in the field of chemical should know like your first Lithium battery was set up in Gujarat so Lithium factory what is the importance of Lithium and all that kind of general areas then your semiconductors and all that model of development you have some time just make 4:05 so that you don't have to think it over isn't it similarly when we started discussing about the gift city and all that because this is a very budding issues state where this alcohol Ban has been imposed long back and has been containing suddenly why this free thinking on the part of government in the name of investment meaning there was not investment taking place earlier why it is happening now what kind of you take it is up to you but whatever you take try to stick to that give reason is aware that this girl is capable of thinking differently and she has her own mind also important because you are going to be a part of the civil services you have to have your independent thinking your independent views like one point of time you said I would not like to rate the government very dangerous to say that I read this much and then who are you like to read as a person of common products what do you feel then you are giving a Caveat that don't ask me any questions about certain conditions but it should also appear that thinking mind so that kind of thing should not happen similarly if you are able to prioritise your arguments much better presentation crisis major issue of human suffering and you lost sight of that human being if it happens to us how you react so that is very important so I just prioritise your views otherwise you are coming from land of Gandhi Gandhiji views on women empowerment that is very important so how far it is relevant in today's country because for the first time the country is happening in Gujarat only the speed of bullet train what is what do you mean by high speed what is Semi high speed trains and all that what is the total 8 km length total quality is going tunnel house under sea also in Mumbai BKC which is an engineering marvel to those things just have a look at that you will come to know about it which agency is funding this project that you should I know whether you know or not It is funded by Japanese so because you are aspirant also of the civil services how many stations are there it should be able to tell that 32 Station how many how many sufficient and have confidence in yourself speaking it was very fast novels about it I was relaxed from inside but when I went outside in a real is it what I have done so I not at one point that I was speaking very fast I believe I speak more try to I don't want you to care your natural history then what happens in the whole process you lose yourself try to be very normal while speaking also you have to have confidence in yourself to the point candidate must tell you good candidate and you be getting good marks also 10.5 specific then you will able to give a much better presentation of yourself a lot of economic terms I told economics many time in every answer I was putting economics in that it because wait for a few seconds and don't speak permission every now and then give me some times irritating third question you should know the moment try to understand then try to collect your thoughts the moment you are able to conserve up your ideas will come out with answers immediately if I say something immediately you repeat then you lose height of the central theme mind that someone you like answer so what goes in my mind jaldi answer slogan everybody maintain your personal integrity and integrity of purpose throughout the season and high level of energy if you don't know answer of 345 initial questions I said you don't you should not do that you should not do that ok but the woman linkage of women with everything is I have also written in my dear how to cover the tallest buildings when I was looking for the women issues this things does not hurt my mind that I have to do that also there are questions related to patriarchy and of course material being a woman you should always be considering the fact that of course you must always have because as recently you might have seen Nari Shakti Vandana adhiniyam now you have seen the roll of the society how women are basically progressing right in the context of that try to relate this with the particular perspective of the vision of the government presently that are actually doing in the context of women reservation so you would like to frame such aspects that of course beyond that they are also has to be something called human relation values relation that actually matters the particular contradictions comes where the psychological constraints are actually put you might have seen that despite representation is of course coming up right now but there are of course psychological barriers that Mahila Hogi to she would not be able to perform well right so in the context of that grassroot level reality is must be realised Grass root level leadership must be promoted ok you can say local debate dialogue shape programs must be organised Yuva Sansad programs so that actually this may include at the school level right from the government that will actually destroy the cause barriers which are the destroy this particular gender barrier which is actually very much prevalent and then of course tried to represent the government must focus on representing them as a role model this could be some of the views in which you can actually frame search answers
