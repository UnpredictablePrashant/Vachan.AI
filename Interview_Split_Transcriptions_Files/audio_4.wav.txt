what is not out for civil engineering as your optional paper for the UPSC could you please tell me what is the history of Banaras Hindu University state of rich land and poor people what makes sense is this tell me what is the meaning of this term cancel culture this has been a news a lot how many digits are in Jharkhand and what is their status right now good morning good morning good morning please give a brief introduction about yourself my name is Aditya Kesari I was born and brought up in Deoghar the cultural capital of Jharkhand I completed my graduation from Civil Engineering from IIT BHU in 2022 after that I am preparing for civil services my hobbies include playing guitar reading and teaching about astronomy and science fiction novels and movies you did your graduation with civil engineering for civil engineering as your optional paper for the UPSC because the study material of sociology was easily available along with her my teachers and also my friends suggested me to all for Sociology and also sir there was a correlation with GS subjects with sociology answer I found sociology interesting sir and I wish to learn more other than civil engineering sociology or civil engineering I think currently I am so better in Sociology sir because recently I have studied more civil engineering skills and not completely forgotten sir I need to brush it up sir ok suppose you get selected and posted as the district magistrate in one of the districts in Jharkhand for your knowledge or education in civil engineering is going to help you overseeing the projects there is a developing states there are many Infrastructure Projects happening in Jharkhand so in that way sir civil engineering skills will help me to better supervise different projects also the engineering aspect also provides logical and objective thinking so in that sensor country particularly in the government sector it is happening that our projects are taking long time to get completed resulting in time over and cost of run so what should be done to ensure that project completed in time and within the budget allocation the biggest reasons for delay in projects are legal reasons and such as environmental creations there are there is still sir not very good implementation of a single window clearance system these are the prominent reasons are and to his in the infrastructure projects are we can think about the better implementation of PM Gati Shakti mission sir and single window clearance systems are environmental concerns suppose you are Highway project is passing through your area where you are posted as district magistrate what could be environmental concerns in that area just imagine the situation environmental concerns first should be due to deforestation then due to Constructions are many Chemicals will be released and also sir due to Excess due to use of groundwater for construction sir it may lead to depletion of groundwater tables are mangroves yes sir what are mangroves sir mangroves are trees that are found in intertidal regions are they have aerobic roots are which uses which uses which uses for respiration transpiration by the root sir and they can they can survive against high salinity are going through that mangrove area is what precautions you take mangroves are very important sir for environmental aspect and also to safeguard against coastal and tidal damages so if a project is passing through mangrove area we need to make sure that there is compensatory afforestation regarding mangrove solution and secondly sir then to be awareness generation among the people living there to safeguard other means other means of forestation or what do you mean by social impact assessment yes sir social impact assessment is done in the initial phases of a project to find out what are the cost benefit what will be the cost incurred and benefits comprehensively not just economically but also regarding social impacts how it would impact the native society and also about economic impact sir about the settlement of the population of that area which is the project is passing social impact will include the concerns of regarding the resettlement and Rehabilitation policy you are from Banaras Hindu University tell me what is the history of Banaras Hindu University sir BHU was started by mahamana Pandit Madan Mohan Malviya 1916 on the on the nearby The Central Hindu School which was started by Annie Besant in 1898 it was started by donations from king of Banaras and Darbhanga it was mainly focused to provide Indians with indigenous education along with western education sir absolutely correct but my second question that is of course because you are coming from one of the most prestigious institutions in India and of course one thing that always worry that makes me very always and of course I am very much sad with the reality that indian universities ranking are not very much fairly represented across the globe now could you please highlight me what is the reason for that reason is intellectual properties are first reason there are low number of patents from premier Institutions and secondly infrastructural delay however sir Global rankings also have some buyers are regarding perceptions are so perception among foreign students etc so that also leads to reduction in exception what do you mean the foreign rankings include perception like how other students foreign students think about such Institutions are and different which ranking is Biased on the protection of perception are you sure about that perception is also taken into account that is of course linked with the first one now keeping in mind the secular values and secular ethos in the cultural and of course religious mosaic in India now how justified is the name of Banaras Hindu University where the expression Hindu has been used in if you could recognise the history you yourself know that impact Pandit Madan Mohan Malviya has been expelled from his community because he was one who was proliferating the idea of Hindu Muslim Unity but how justified it is to have a Hindu in the secular values of our democracy today sir Hindu In the name Banaras Hindu University does not reflect the religion Sir but it's a way of life sir as Supreme Court has also said sir so it is a secular institution with a secular values however the name does not reflect the only religion but the way of life sir ok does not there is no problem with the name what about Aligarh Muslim University in Dehradun universities which are specifically oriented or the nomenclature which is of course used is Muslim and sometimes there are other communities Institutions what is the requirement of that because India of course is a secular democracy sir I think it was due to historical reasons institution was opened for that particular upliftment of that particular section of society that is why the name persist however they are completely secure institution with secular values and the name does not reflect ok paragraph now very very recently secular the expression secular and of course the expression socialist is much debated in the Parliament right because of Preamble Amendment Bill that was of course moved now my question to you is do you really think that secularism as it has been arranged by various countries secularism is of course in India is a compromised secularism to that point so that is a compromise secularism India has developed secularism on its own parcel Indian secularism is not is different from Western secularism Indian secularism comprises of unification of religion and also and promotion of all religious group instead of not doing anything about religion sir in that sense I would not come to that point thank you thank you from Jharkhand is a state of rich land and poor people what makes sense is this is because mam Jharkhand is one of the most prominent mineral producing state of our nation it produces 40% of the minerals of the country it contains 40% of the members of the country however man in different indexes like literacy index Human Development Index Jharkhand legs and Jharkhand is not in a better position there are various reasons such as political stability is there have been 11 chief minister in 22 years also when there is economic inequalities and the share of services in the GDP gsdp of Jharkhand is also poor these are the reason your mother runs a business of her own Government of India has done a lot for small businesses can you name a few schemes some of the schemes include MSME schemes mam Soumitra schemes tell me the schemes that your mother is taking benefit from sorry mam I am not sure you have interest in teaching astronomy can you teach me a topic of astronomy let's say I am a student of 5th standard 5th standard student mam I would like to teach her about the eclipse mam that is simple to understand why eclipse has happened both solar and lunar eclipses so it is sociology have you heard about the concept was given by MS Srinivasan it refers to imitations of of lifestyles of higher caste by lowercase in order to increase their stature increase their social mobility within the caste system and found yourself in middle of a fight with someone angry angry bird angry with myself only by reading different kinds of novels I know some breathing exercises also so this made me make myself if you have to bring a novel to reality for making India a developed nation which novel would you drink it's not a futuristic novel but in the novel why Nations fail the author tries to say that political democracy or political structure of a country leads to economic development so in that sense mam though as compared to China and India when it is often said that China is you superpower and all in the in that novel mam it says that the political democracy of India will provide more economic success later so that novel mam I would like to bring in reality is known for its particular kind of Mela which is called as a district magistrate what you will do to ensure that the crowd of this Shravani Mela is managed because that is a huge problem district magistrate the planning must start for Shravani Mela enters which is in generally in July August so first would be to esti how many people would be coming to Deoghar for worship second would be to plan accordingly with Holistic planning with different departments of the government so as to provide necessary facilities and security should be required to maintain the crowd and 43 sir there would be awareness generation regarding rules and regulations to the devotees right and you have put Jharkhand as your home cader are you a domicile of Jharkhand what is the requirement for a person to be a domicile of Jharkhand recently state government has passed a law regarding that their for father's name must be in the 1932 Sensex which was which was done by the British sir that is the census in 19932 or something else it was a service centre sure you have also put sociology as your optional paper right there is a particular group of tribals called as PVT GS particularly vulnerable tribal groups how many PVT GS are in Jharkhand and what is their status right now sir there are 8 PPT in Jharkhand some of them include Azure pahadiyan Pahadiya etc are improving sir however they are still hacking in health and educational outcomes what is the criteria for defining tribal as PPT that was given by the commission itself was low population low use of Technology isolation these things you are also a civil engineer let me ask you something 26500 tons of Steel right something without nut and bolts and engineering marvel what I am talking about can I take again so what kind of bridges this is a cantilever Bridge cantilever and why this is a cantilever Bridge why there are no pillars because they use the methods of instead of nuts and boots the use riveting methods are to rivet different parts of the Steel structure to form of Jharkhand is beautiful Jharkhand itself means the land of charge they have mountains everything right they have netarhat still Jharkhand is not on the one of the famous tourist hotspots of India so as a Civil Servant what will be your steps to put Jharkhand back on the map of tourism my steps include firstly sir I will talk my with my colleagues to come and visit Jharkhand and also to spread the word sir second sir extensively use social media and other platforms to generate curiosity and keen interest about Jharkhand thirdly sir I will request the central government also from the state government site that Jharkhand should be treated as an important place of tourism and it has huge potential to attract devotees and tourism of sociology tell me what is the meaning of this term cancel culture this has been in Sar cancel culture is done by people who prefer status quiz on over change so whenever there is a change in the society they respond or react violently in social media and other platforms to not do not change the status quiz of the society sir this is so who is right here like the people who are being opposed through the cancel culture or like who are actually propagating this cancel culture sir both have valid reasons to retaliate sir however it needs to be a balance give an example like where it was regarding marriage of the LGBT community there were many backless by writing people against providing legal legality the same sex marriage would have like bad effect on the Institution of marriage Sir marriage as an institution will not have a bad effect the institution itself changes and itself evolved sir so in that sense it will not have a bad effect however said the change must be brought from the people from the legislation not from the Judiciary sir so like the government and the Judiciary they should not take any proactive step they should wait for the community to realise it and steps should be taken by government sir by the legislature because they represent the people sir and people should also be made aware about the Human Rights recently UAE consensus or Dubai consensus was in news what is it sorry I am not the Russia Ukraine war has been going on for a long time what is India's stand is India is not supporting Russia India supporting peace between the two countries who is the agriculture in this case regarding it Russia claims that it's the aggression of NATO expansion of UK currency is the adventures is the claims of Russia ok is India right in buying that crude oil discounted crude oil from Russia which is helping Russia to continue the war against Ukraine sir yes sir India is correct because any foreign policy must get aligned with the national interest of the countryside so in that sensor India is correct because we need oil for growth and that is why sir you come from Jharkhand it's the religious place of Santhal sir where they worship sir ok and why was it rain not self help groups of humans who provide that in Jharkhand there has been 11 chief ministers in 22 years or 20 so what do you think like this shows the strength of democracy or the weakness in democracy sir it's not about strength and weakness of democracy but strength and weakness of the parties are they are not able to collaborate and they are not it must be showing the weakness of the political party then yes sir in one sensor there are showing the weaknesses of political parties they are not able to we should have one person continue for a long time not the people must realise the parties must realise that a stable democracy is stable quality is important for growth sir so in that sensor we should have a long tenure of chief minister to complete their 10 years tell me Shivling at Deoghar is called it is one of the Jyotirling as mentioned by so what is the significance of the Jyotirling in there is a historical there is a mythological story regarding that Ravana went to Kailash and Sa himself sacrifice 9 of his heads after that by Lord Shiva gave him his part as a sibling sir and it was established in Deoghar sir he was initially trying to take it to Sri Lanka Highway Vishnu ji in Gwala Avatar managed to put it in Deoghar sir that is the mythical stories and why devotees take water from Ganga at a place called Sultanganj and go to Deoghar all the way it is again Lord Rama took the water from Ganges near Sultanganj and put it on Devghar Shivling sir in order to win back win against Ravana sir so both Ram and Ravan are devotees of Shivaji in that sense to achieve prosperity and health extra people who don't stop from Sultanganj to Deoghar which is 108 km walking surrounding thank you so much your interview is on 10th January question such as why it is called Jyotirlinga I was not completely sure about it also about the status of sts and tribals in Jharkhand answer regarding situational questions like SDM what would you do I should have given more concrete answers 12th wherever you did not know admitted that I latest hot should be not knowing and still speaking is a sort of committing suicide yes yes never ever do that so many things what doesn't know you don't know don't know but even without knowing if you start speaking then that you always your personal integrity and integrity of purpose should never be compromised you should remain intact for the interview that is very important for you have a very good background and you are coming from Jharkhand lot of interest rate current affairs particularly in particular related to Jharkhand from all aspects your government schemes that area initiated by the state government find the central government then your economic backwardness of Jharkhand is always question why why it is so low in all the rankings you should buy Niti Aayog and other various Agencies so you have to prepare it and never give a very negative picture of the state from you come from yes there are issues are there of course but there are solution to be very positive person blindly defending it should be different with logic yes sir giving logical analysis have to be very very balanced very constructive thoughts you should Express never ever give me a thing or give a negative connotation to anything what is your clarity of mind this is a mind should not appear to cluttered is very clear level 100% clear person and your communication skill is good and your knowledge on a variety of issue is that only 456 parameters based on which your personality will be adjusted by the board rest of knowledge is not test of personality will be question asking this question good very good personality and board will be really happy to give you good marks with a view to take you to the Civil Services interview to choose a subject which is not his comfort zone on outside discomfort zone to choose a subject because of a strategy isn't it there at least name part you should not be Srinivasan should be administered as theories will be there by people they ask you about sanskritization they may ask you about the little tradition great tradition and there has been criticism also Indian sociology was given the theory of organisation and all that he has also criticized on what basis and this transition theory in United States from which empirical studies conducted by Mr all those things as a student I don't know anything about I can tell you from my readings that on which community medicine studies and best civil engineering area is another area where you may be asked one is the general question which you asked and you are good and then about the engineering Marvels of the country beat bridges and all that recently Bridge has come up in Chenab so what is the structural design of that Bridge because nobody will interested in knowing the bridge is what is the height of the bridge what do you mean by this suspension bridge what is suspension business where you want to go for well Foundation where you want to go for exactly all those things constructed a big way what are the new materials which are being used in civil engineer importance of fly ash and all you only said fly ash and all those you should be able to otherwise I wonderful candidate just prepare what a little time is there at your disposal read your state thoroughly misery Bihar also and prohibition we are not prohibition in Jharkhand ok and travel try to ask you question yourself have admitted tribal issue because sociology important does it relate to Travels or not question does it cover excellent candidate have confidence in yourself go with a positive body language while on face internally may be nervous it should not get reflected on your face you should be a very happy brimming person Radiance on your face many people said that you should take a delay of 35 seconds more don't try to mechanical be or normal sale be your natural cell as long as you are talking sense as long as you are giving logic Nobody's bothered in the board because you do once you enter you don't great as once you come you don't take our permission because these are problems but once you engage into discussion and animated discussion and meaningful discussion
