please tell me what are the problems you have seen differently abled people face in our country so I just want a sociology I will look at the factors responsible for lower participation of women in work space what do you understand by one China policy then what do you mean by momentum investing what is minerals good afternoon good afternoon please give a brief introduction about yourself I am from Kolhapur district of Maharashtra which is used to be known as Kuntal city in ancient times I have completed my graduation in Computer Science and Engineering from Walchand College of Engineering Sangli currently I have been provisionally selected in EPFO SSA post have a joint there no sir you are not joined that do you have any ideas any plan of joining not because two days before you have any physical what is that I am having that cerebral palsy what is the treatment you are taking for that I am taking medicine from Neurologist and they also suggest me to take some Physiotherapy but currently I am not doing that because of my commitment to studies tell me what are the problems you have seen differently abled people face in our country the basic problem different table people face are there are not directly connected with ministry of society because it is not possible them to reach mainstream society and education in education also they facing lots of problem because the school infrastructure is not differently abled friendly currently but government is making different schemes in Maharashtra state also as well as Central Government also why is that your student people who are otherwise able so called abled people at the differently abled people the basic different person as sometimes in the way of compassion they want to help them or they sometimes they think that they are not enough capable but now that stigma is changing because of that the word given is introduced by honorable Prime Minister now that our society is also looking differently at differently abled people have you done anything really good for the differently abled people at your level yes sir I am currently connected with that one of the NG of in Maharashtra manobal NGO who is working for differently abled people I am helping helping different labels to done in education field and guiding them for career in education as well as in civil services tell me what else could be done to empower the people were having disabilities a person who are facing different table in their life we should connect them with education system as well as well as we should empower them to medical treatment because the medical treatment for different people persons are mostly costliest and they are not aware about that Healthcare facility for them even though I am educated educated engineer still in 2018 itself I came to know about my disability so it shows that we are lacking in awareness itself tell me India is facing many issues one such issue is the issue of unemployment do you think unemployment is problem in India unemployment in any society itself a problem the but government is already trying to give employment to the people itself to different initiative even that there encouraging to enroll in different skill program what do you mean by dividend demographic dividend it is the term used for other labour force between age of 15 259 years currently India is having demographic dividend 28 as average age so on the one hand we have the issue of unemployment the issue of unskilled labour and on the other hand we claim that this is an asset to the country demographic dividend so how do you correlate the two situations problems are there in our society but government as well as people as per as per to do something for the nation they are they are enough capabilities even if you have the demographic dividend after 28 years age we have capabilities to convert that demographic dividend which ensures that India will become one of the developed country in future sociology what was the standing of marks about surplus pool of labour School of surplus full of workers or surplus pool of labour for yes I am not able to recorded right now ok and what do you understand by labour force participation rate labour force participation rate it is a labour force who are willing to willing to participate in the workforce divided by death formula between labour force and work force which group of a population of a territory is considered labour force start with basic information what is the population of Maharashtra it is around 12 crore 12 crore so do you feel that all the 12 crore people in Maharashtra are in the age group willing to work or capable to work no sir some of them are called working age people working people rrr included in working age population the person who are completed age of 15 till 59 years that and who are seeking employment their Accounting in labour force so those were in the age group of 15 and seeking job so on that ground labour force participation rate is calculated what is the labour force participation rate of women in Maharashtra approximately and approximately the labour force participation rate in Maharashtra is around 30% sir and most of them are in urban area in rural area most of the women are from that rural areas of their working in agricultural field to MGNREGA scheme as per month for lower participation of women in workspace there are many problem faced by women already having burden of their families to take responsibility of their family members as Children's and the most of the earlier Womens are not that much educated and that must not aware about their workforce that's why they are not getting employment and one of the reason is also patriarchy in our society that's not will allowing them to work in society would you understand by social security and what part of the workforce in India are having access to social security provisions social security includes that after retirement provision for as well as mentioned it included in the social security and what part of workforce is having access sorry I am not available in selected in EPFO have you any idea what is the number of account holders of PPF Farhan understand by one China policy Chinese different initial want to create their hegemony in world power is that one China policy or like it is something to do with Taiwan and it's status you are not you can look it up so we often hear this term Global South right what is global south and is it synonymous with the third world that we talk about yes that we can say that it is the Aspiring the third world countries who are neglected in the mainstream that world politics ok India has 2 + 2 format dialogue with some countries what is the 2 + 2 format dialogue with how many countries we have this relationship ministry of defence as well as minister of external affairs having dialogue countries currently we are having the 2 + 2 with Australia one is Australia others other I am not able to record if you talk about India's West Asia policy then which are the three most important countries according to you with which we need to have good relations in West Asia so that every country in the world is important for us we cannot discriminate about that but what is still very important for us investigation sorry I am not ok recently there was this National Youth festival celebrated where exactly it was celebrated which part of Maharashtra longest sea bridge has been inaugurated where is that and it connects which two parts of Maharashtra it is the distance that time required for two ports of Maharashtra that is Mumbai port and Nehru port it will it has capacity to travel more than 70000 vehicles on that Bridge ok and what is the reason controversy about this Bridge it has been recently inaugurated but there are a lot of pictures and many things are getting viral about this page on that Bridge many people are treating it as a tourism place having that their vehicles and making videos as well as their spending time a lot there my final question to you because you come from Maharashtra and there has been anti defection law which has been in news who is the speaker of Maharashtra assembly right now and weather the power of deciding on anti defection law should be disqualification under this should be taken away from the speaker I am asking you who is the speaker of Maharashtra assembly right now and whether the power to decide on dis Kishan should be taken away from the speaker the current speaker of Maharashtra is the Mr narvekar and the power to decide the anti-defection is according to constitution it also it is with only speaker only so we cannot take the power of speaker in that case you should not take care don't you think that speaker is sometimes acting in a Biased manner we cannot say the speaker always acting in the bias manner that the post of the speaker is not Biased with any political party it is post of that whole that Vidhan Sabha Parliament thank you what do you mean by momentum interesting that the share price of one particular company or one particular share is increasing we start investing more that is what it is so do you think that it is beneficial for the Indian economy I will ask you another question do you think that the provisions laid under article 30 that is the educational institution and instead by minorities do you think that that particular article was intended to restrict the minorities I think that article is for the empowerment of minority it's not for the treatment of that minority people but we have seen lately we have seen that minorities have been elected or you know have been appointed for administration of those Institutions from the minorities only why not from the outside I don't think this is true because many of the minority institution also have that members from other community RM is to make life easier for minorities rather than doing a restricted from a particular community you are from Maharashtra what is the role of Maratha empire for shaking the Maharashtra state Maratha empire give the identity to the Maharashtra people as one of the leader of Maharashtra that Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was known as the father of Maratha empire solidarity among the people promoted secularism as well as tolerance policy plot Maharashtra I think that is the reason that Maharashtra is so much developed and most peaceful state in India financial capital of India so what is the role in States economy currently Maharashtra contribute to 14% of GDP in India's total GDP current as well as most of the financial institution having headquarter in Mumbai itself and most as well as 40% of direct taxes in our country is contribute from Maharashtra itself list UNESCO heritage sites in Maharashtra first one is Ajanta Caves second one is Ellora cave third one is Elephanta Caves in Maharashtra 4th one is Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus festivals of Maharashtra Lavani is one of the famous in Maharashtra region what are strategic minerals can you name a few minerals that are very crucial for India's developmental aspirations but we do not have reserves for the same Lithium is one of the mineral we are aspirant have but we don't have that much resources currently why Lithium is important for India the Lithium is used in that electric vehicle batteries as well as mobile phone batteries as well as electronic material from which countries we are importing Lithium sorry sorry do you know about few minerals which India has an abundance and exports you just mention something about the vehicles do you think electronic vehicles are actually green vehicles tell us something about matter words is a technology which is created using that Artificial Intelligence and through Augmented reality as well as virtual reality ok and what is the difference between Augmented reality and virtual reality in Augmented reality of the person can visit different places physically but virtual reality we are having that virtual reality camera through that we can have that pictures or we can assign the different reality can you think of some Areas where metaverse can find applications full future opportunities in we can have in future iot devices with me Towers can is our life easy recently a case related to metaverse came to the news where the digital Avatar of a girl was assaulted by the digital Avatar of human and this case was reported in UK do you think that women are not safe even in the virtu environment we cannot say that that women are not safe it's depend upon the society where leaving if we are promoting women empowerment in one day we can have that empowerment of the women and they can also have the stand and for because of one and two people were cannot see that a woman's are not empower ok so according to you what can be done to ensure a safe and sustainable environment in these digital spaces because currently we have a lot of rules and regulations for the physical environment but we are still in a developmental stage towards the digital spaces I think we should come with one of the Legislature and some direction to use of digital technology so that we can have guidelines for them and we can use effectively OK what is mental health mental health is one of the aspect of persons held which deals with psychology of human brain ok so is it just a psychological attribute or it has some biological basis also it also have some biological basis also what is it ok can you tell us

they can have consultation and they can improve their health we are witnessing a growing number of motivational speakers on social media platforms why do you think this is happening currently we are witnessing a growing number of motivational speakers on social media platforms and otherwise also why do you think this is happening is providing us good platform to raise our eyes or to reach each aspect of the society that is the reason I think that more number of people are motivation people are using social media to reach the people to reach their audience to send their message to people ok
