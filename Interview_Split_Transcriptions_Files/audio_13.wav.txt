XUV 500 RBI had approved more than anything 8000 crores as dividends to the central government to how dividend is paid to the central government and why the dividend is better than sociology is a common sense of the Middle East of West Asia we refer to the creation and what crisis how RBI issues a currency note if you become a bureaucrat tell me what are the steps that you are going to take to tackle the issues related to caste in our society yes coming good morning please visited please give a brief introduction about yourself and I have done my graduation in physics Honours from Hindu College Delhi University and after that I have taken a job as a grade B officer in Reserve Bank of India and I am working days since 2 years and I am also a UPSC aspirant where are you posted Twinkle right now working in the RBI had approved more than I think 8000 crores as dividends to the central government and why the dividend history of the government is the shareholder of RBI so RBI has whatever operations RBI performs so any profits so after taking care of the expenses and payment to the the surplus amount which is left is paid to the government since government is a shareholder of RBI so in that sense it gets the surplus amount is determined by the RBI how it is determined after the profits the and after fulfilling the Reserve requirements like payment to the general reserve or any other reserve so the amount which is left after that is what is the capitalisation is when the government puts in capital into the banks to improve the financial position why it is required amount of capital first of all to ensure that depositors interests are served and deposit of confidence is maintained and in any case of any instance where is when and there is a risk of bank failure the bank in rely on capital to pay the news to the department what is the correlation between the npa and Bank recapitalization let's leave it there must have heard about the hedging of foreign exchange risk what is this concept we are ensuring ourselves against the risk which arises due to changes in the exchange rate what is the benefit of it why should one go for aging of funds a lot of factors which are not under our control for example any geopolitical conflict or something which is there so that has an effect on the interest rate which in turn affects are the cost of our imports of the situation of exports and India is dependent on import like like petroleum for its energy security so it becomes all the more important that we are secure ok you are a student of Physics and opted for sociology as your optional subject for the UPSC why is instant of you should or for a subject like sociology I am interested in Sociology subject and I could not get a chance to study it in school because because we only had the option we do not have the option of choosing the Humanities subject along with PCM so that's why I feel that right now is the transferring I can study that I have interest in that subject and I also believe that it was manageable along with job because I do I really love physics but it gets a little difficult to manage physics optional with job to Sociology had both the benefits institution where in the Institutions and the processes of society are such that men dominate and press do you think everything is bad in patriarchy and silver lining also in the patriarchy inherently patriarchy is I do not support patriarchy inherently but certain factors because we as women we are since the current social reality such that we have to live with it so certain things I like we call it patriarchal bargain so for if I may give an example like I had this privilege that my father used to drop me to the metro station for entire 3 years of college which I had but my brother used to go into a cab from the very first day so these are certain things but if you look at the core concept the very reason that he has to drop me is because it's not considered safe for women to go out at night what you mean by feminism I am a feminist because I believe that men and women should have equal rights when it comes to work opportunities or or even when it come when it comes to the Expectations with society has so I believe that since I am working person and till now in my family no woman has worked so I believe that in my capacity I have taken the first step to promote quality what are the problems lady of the generally faces at the workplace the first problem which I believe is that women are they have to put in extra efforts to be treated at power and even when they are putting in extra efforts people still have this thing in mind that she is getting favoured just because she is a female officer so that bias is always there that inherently we have something and it's just because we are female we are getting the advantage and say another thing is that due to societal Expectations if a woman is career oriented or is performing well in in office then there's always this believe that she might not be a good mother like I have I am not a mother so I am not had any personal experience but this is what I have seen that some very good female employees are there but behind their back people are like this is not take care of her daughter sociology as a subject is it is easier for you to manage with your work on contrary physics I am not exactly common sensible as in the things which we study they have an overlap with our common sense knowledge so sociology is not common sensible person but the things which we study we are already familiar with that so things like patriarchy or feminism or even if we talk about cast it's not that we are completely blank about these things or we do not know anything everyone has some basic knowledge but studying sociology as a subject has broadened my perspective so earlier I used to just think from may be one or two perspectives but sociology give me variety of perpetual download this only common sense common understanding and everyday realities are there different because everyone's common sense is based on that particular person or his perception his perception of reality so it might not actually for example like I believe that patriarchy is everyday reality in the current scenario but someone my common sense might be different from somebody else is common sense someone might feel that it's very common sense because women are the weaker sex so it's but natural that they are performing household chores and they are not able to work outside so common sense technology the recent controversy going around the period leave so what is the latent and manifest function of this are you in favour of periodic you are a manager because I believe that it will talk about quality it would provide a level playing field quality is not just about giving similar circumstances to every person it's about dealing with different situations differently so seriously it's a reality for women very painful and discomforting for some so just like on the similar concept that we have a maternity leave or hardship leaf for females so I think on similar lines menstrual leave is also justified because it except the fact that this is a reality of latent and manifest function of this kind of controversy of manifest function of the manifest function is that a woman who is in pain or who is in discomfort gets the chance to rest and recover the time and latent function is that it sends a message that we are that we are caring about the other half of the population because mostly work places are just designed keeping the male prototype in mind and periodic labour service periodic labour force service and the reason also it is found that the graduate people are found to be more unemployed right the number has increased as compared to other developing countries and on the other hand if I see if I take women as a category so women the graduate women are more employability is also more but their participation in the labour market is less so what do you understand by this where is the problem line I think that graduate women mostly if they are there is this perception in society that you are from a well to do family then women are discouraged to work because it is seen in a negative light and considering the current scenario in job markets the graduate employment rate is lower because the graduates are not getting the job which they expect because of their educational qualification so especially for women in such a scenario the family as well as themselves they are sort of discouraged by this because not want to did not want the daughters or their daughter in laws to work for a job which is below there you need to say that the skill appropriate jobs are not available in the market thank you Twinkle what is operation Ajay operation is going on in the Middle East of West Asia as we refer to the region and there was an attack on October 7th by how much on Israel and then the retaliatory bombing of Israel on girls and so does two wrongs make a right so then what should be Indian government stand on the disproportionate of Indian government is driven primarily by National interest for keeping in mind are relations with Israel and the and the in the importance of those collaborations India India is not directly criticizing it but definitely India has maintained the stand that they should be a humanitarian a ceasefire on this and the hostel so the US and other Western countries they have been demanding not ceasefire but humanitarian causes what are vegetarian causes I am not very sure but I think that whatever supplies are required for like food supplies a basic requirements they are not stopped now you are working in RBI so this is what we often see is that Indian government is trying to have the international trade payments in local currency interest in line with what countries globally are doing so that we do not have to depend hard currency which is Dollar currently ok so internationalisation of rupee do you think it is reasonable expectation or it is like highly optimistic on our part I believe that it is reasonable and India is taking a lot of steps in that direction like the Rupee ruble payment system with Russia do it is facing certain issues but that step and we are moving towards increased capital account convertibility also and RBI is also encouraging derivative instruments in this context only we often hear about Vostro and nostro account exactly but they are comes like an Indian bank has with the foreign bank account so that it can be used to settle payments what are the reasons for the real reasons for the formic crisis that is being faced by Sri Lanka any two three four reasons I think that is the primary reason and unemployment can you can look it up why do bankers don't like haircuts so because it decreases the amount which a person is able to recover from a non performing asset so it is bad for the banking question to you what do you understand by constitutional silence and can you give me an example where we see it in place of the constitution which is not provide a particular Timeline to act on certain thing that is being used to not take an action for example Governors of various state governments are sitting on the basis for very long time and they are not taking action that article I can't recover you are a physics graduate from Hindu College 9.480 CGPA you have got scholarship to inspire right now you are in RBI your optional is sociology you want to work with I mean administration so is this not very random do you think do you think there is any connecting dots for 5 random things initially was my aspirations to become an IAS officer that was something which was constant throughout since college and through RBI and right now and other than that sir I was since childhood I was interested in science and mathematics so that was the reason I choose science stream but it was later on when I realised when I explored my interest in other areas in the field of economics and even sociology we also interested me so I felt that not be right to just bound myself to the field which I had initially chosen and explore my other interested as well right one of your interests are in French right as a foreign language in civil services the French can be useful if you opt for Foreign Services right but your I mean preference for Foreign Services is quite below and it is given below then revenue services so how your knowledge of French is going to help the administration in general moving towards para diplomacy also so in those circumstances my knowledge of French may be helpful but I also believe that if not directly because then we can pretty much manage with any Global interaction but I believe that indirectly also learning French will help me a lot it has a provided me with the skills associated with language learning and I also believe that I'll be able to pick up any other language also faster so if I am posted in a cadre which is not in my home state for example South or North East so I think I would be able to pick up that language and learning French has also taught me that if we learn a language we also start to respect that culture even more fine Central Bank right bankers are known for their long working hours recently there was a statement by Narayan Murthy one of the respected figures of industry that you should be ready to work for at least 70 hours a week what is your take on that statement has also received a lot of backlash the way I see it is that he does not mean that workers should be forced to work 70 hours a week I believe that what he means is that workers people you should be willing to work 70 hours so we need to have that motivation and we need to have that job for which we have that motivation so it should come it should be an intrinsic thing that I am very passionate about the work I do and I am ready to put in 70 hours so that it is not even feel like work to me sorry you are with RBI one of the primary job of RBI is as issuer of currency notes right how RBI issues a currency note is there any legal provision is there any kind of backup through which RBI can read notes of the RBI act RBI is empowered authority to issue the currency notes and the notes by certain assets which are not like we have a limited reserve system for this so it's not that every every amount of currency is backed by an equivalent amount of assets but we do have certain percentage is not printing Rupee 1 currency note so why why just one currency note was left to government and every other nodes are being printed by RBI I think it is to it is to show that the prime authority in the country regarding managing the ultimate authority lies with the government last question to you is what is open market operations in context of RBI and how this is going to help in containing inflation are used by RBI for liquidity management bonds in the market so as to control the a bonus and the inflation RBI engagement in the market so by selling out liquidity from the system amount currency the liquidity in which is there in circulation would decrease so the aggregate that would have an impact of the aggregate demand would be decreased to the inflation would be lowered on the other hand if RBI buys bonds in the market it would have to push liquidity into the market which would Twinkle you have studied Sociology and you like watching movies according to you what are the top three issues which have not yet found representation through movies cast it has found some representation but not to that level which we might expect and power political power dynamics in general and also political power also as the next sociological aspects third one I think ok if you become a bureaucrat tell me what are the steps that you are going to take to tackle the issues related to caste in our society sir as a bureaucrat I would first ensure that the that untouchability both in its latent and manifest forms is eradicated because it's part of Article 17 also and next I would ensure that all the benefits of affirmative action they reach to the bottom and they reach every person who deserves it for example we do have reservations for scheduled caste and Scheduled Tribes but less very small percentage of the cars are actually benefiting from it and the other ones are not able to read the benefits since they do not get the primary education of the primary health facilities to the person is not even equipped to reach to that level of College admissions or job prospects where in those who is the applicable so I think I would work on this area have you watched the 12th film movie based on the partially have watched can you tell us what is the central theme of this movie is that the protagonist of the movie was someone who used to was in a school where teaching sorry cheating was very prevalent and they used to treat and pass in the exams and after that he met in IPS officer and he was really motivated by his honesty and integrity and then he decided to pursue this examination so it shows the struggles of that person coming from a weaker background and how he was this movie tackles are very important social aspect do you think such movies can have a big future in the Indian cinema where Stardom is often related to success they have a lot of scope because people are giving really positive views about this movie and if such movies I think even producers or directors to take a step because if more such movies are produced then audience would be able to see it and then appreciated and the market for such movies would also increase ok so I think the initial risk the initial amount of risk perception which is there among the directors and producers that has to be over moving further with a discussion India is on its path to become the economic superpower of the world at this point of time which model do you think is best for India capitalism or socialism we do have socialist principles in our working but I believe that the mixed economy model which India has so far followed is working well and difficulties of cost and I think this is the model which India should continue following because we cannot neglect the positives of both of them and the negatives of both of them the section of underprivileged in India is huge so we cannot leave everything to the private sector and government intervention in certain basic goods or services is extremely sorry my final question in this series only what are the top three challenges that you think India will face on its path to become the manufacturing hub of the world is I think the skill mismatch which is in the market and secondary global scenario which is there like decrease in global demand for the export somehow and then which impact the manufacturing industry also and the third one I think is for a lot of starting starting inputs India depends on imports I think that would also what is what do you mean by this is this refers to the generation of people who are born after 1995 96 you belong to generation Z tell me your generation is different from that of her mother in my generation so we have had an exposure to a lot of things which my mother's generation did not have for example increasing prevalence of Technology mobile phones in social media is there generation is also since I previous generation has accumulated certain amount of economic or social capitals so we are on a better footing as compared to their generation and also I think from equality perspective also this generation is better than challenges with this generation is facing special Bazar generation had not faced social media definition social media and its distracting impact and sir I think though we are getting more opportunities to work and to be at par with men I think it also comes with it down sites that we are expected to manage both work and house and you must have seen in the society why is that female contraception are more prevalent in India then male contraception because of the feeling of masculinity and the ideas of nationality that men are not willing to go for contraception and women are women are in a week a position and the male members or even other female members also they are able to impose their will on the women that they need to go for contraception nice interacting with you and interview your interviews on 8th February lot of time is there which item is this for you first experience on certain parameters like I was not very aware about much things about RBI because that's a big gap I feel that you are an excellent candidate for the Civil Services you have gift of the gap your communication skills excellent you state honest for the interview session what is the test of a personality not a question answer session isn't it the personality their various aspects of opportunity where is Assets of personality which are seen and examined by the board while talking to you and asking you questions in the first and foremost is your personal integrity and integrity of purpose what is reflected only the way you answer whether you are answering based on the information knowledge that if you don't know a subject doesn't matter candidate admit that wherever you know try to give a very logical answer to understand intent of the question is very important and correct your thoughts collect your ideas for a while and then come out with answers to the question which has that is important when third thing is that you are not but you did not be questioning the wisdom of board members sir I don't agree with you and that kind of thing even if you feel uncertain things I didn't happen today consultant things if you don't like some opinion expressed by the board members just smiling your opinion is not in my Limited knowledge this is what I think so without confronting that board member are able to drive home your point of view that is question is asked to you asking for some improvement in the system some improvement in the processes and all that they try to show that you can think innovative way out of the box solution as we call it wherever it is possible for you try to give some out of box solutions because that is very much required of expected of a prospective Civil Servant coming to today's this thing RBI have a lot of questions will be asked regarding the roll of RBI so prepare RBI comprehensively because we tried to ask you a few questions of questions without primarily you will find it very convenient to explain what is an hospital contact that also and then the role of upi cbdc which country do you think that Indian Rupee is going to be an international currency in near future you have to give logic for that yes or no so and I have to give arguments also for that why why don't you think that is going to replace dollar and all in the near future so that kind of thing and cbdc why cbdc is there and all that then role of the RBI in various like Recently two three such things come to our mind old pension scheme I think RBI has some views on that so it has asked the state governments to stick to the old pension scheme why should we stick to the old pension scheme if you switch over if you switch back to the old pension scheme what are the problems the government is going to face OK then demonetization there has been a Supreme Court judgement also there is one out of 4.18 minority verdict also given by one of the Honorable lady judges of the supreme court so she had given her own reasons for that you should be aware of what Logix explain while disagree with the Government's decision so that you should be aware sociology we have not ask you too many questions on sociological things is happening in the present India or not size how many Indian sociological thinkers are there concept so that is very important and all that question was asked why RBI is not controlling 1 rupee note so you should be check it was initially a private entity it got a later date even before that one rupee note was in circulation and that time the value of 1 Rupee notes government in want this job to be done by the RBI just have a look at that somebody may ask you have lot of time you see Sri Lanka crisis I think your answer was not very focused very happy explain construction silence article corresponding article you didn't know it is good if you don't know admit I have told you only you are posted at Jaipur state in Delhi so all these issues particularly women centric issues related to Haryana to Delhi and Jaipur restaurant sociology also schemes initiated by the government of India and the state governments and then your daily somebody may ask you the issue of issues of differences between the state government and the central government and the supreme court judgement of that what does that judgement say on that issue so voice you are very natural speaker is very normal natural and your flow is never stops start speaking is good if you are able to take a pause in between it comes naturally your mind and whatever ideas come to your mind you flawlessly try to explain those ideas and those words so very naturally from you what try to maintain some voice modulation and pass it is two things if you are able to work on that it will improve your performance and you are a very potential candidate and tell you extremely potential candidate and you will be getting very good marks in the interview if you have really done well in your men's examination it should be in the list of successful candidates and position do you have any specific question to ask what's the too much repetition when I was explaining the answers speak without stopping so what happens before we appreciate one thing the second thing comes in third thing comes so we are unable to slow down because I don't want you to kill your natural Instinct event while maintaining your natural assistant if speak in a way that one sentence two sentences number one when they make sure that no long sentences and then small small pass second one second 2 seconds false and the second then by that time one or two seconds at least the people sitting this side are able to at least graph the points of the arguments you are trying to make not initially it was ok but gradually when you started explaining involuntary happens for 30 minutes rest for 30 minutes later supposed to be the best in the RBI must be getting a very handsome salary and why you want to leave all that to join a civil services that kind of question makeup so what is there in the civil services in which you don't find in the RBI don't have job satisfaction what is that we are looking for in the Civil Services because I want to switch to its kind of obvious that I am not satisfied here so how do I show it so that it is not any standards and all standards you are not supposed to be saying you are not happy you are not giving a lot of satisfaction and not new areas I am trying to learn but all said and done my passion is to join the civil services and serve the society don't get into that sir I am not liking this job that that it will be a negative connotation of a personality whatever is offered to you don't feel happy so this girl is never happy ok I don't have that kind of attitude know something how do we have to wish the entire board while entering through the moment you are just fumbling I could you when you sort permission from the board good morning you greeted didn't recharge yes so energetic and Happy looking girl and greet positive body language and smile on face good morning is there good morning and then wait for the chair to ask you to send you very cordial conversation you don't have any problem problem wearing what is that shayari what is the importance and then compare two three four sides because you are female candidate some some questions may be there remote possibility but I am not ruling on that also ok show all the best then do well have confidence in yourself in the Mains examination you should be in the top 100 also
