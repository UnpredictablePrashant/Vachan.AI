what do you mean by the population education tell me what is carbon capture can you give me a snapshot of disputes that Haryana has with its neighbouring States according to you I mean who are the best parliamentarians of India tell me what steps India can take to improve its ranking in ease of doing business index thank you sir please give a brief introduction about yourself my name is Ekansh Dhol I am 22 years old I was born in Rohtak but my family shifted to Panchkula thereafter schooling from Chandigarh and then I shifted to Delhi to do my graduation I did B.Com Honours from Shri Ram College of Commerce this is my second attempt at UPSC when did you pass out last year B.Com from SRCC yes sir SSC conducts I Think campus selection also the campus selection I was mesmerized with the idea of civil services since I was a child virus reason is that I come from the state of Haryana and I have seen the impact civil servants can make at the micro and the Macro level so secondly my parents also known as me to do the civil services since I was good in Academics why also had the believe that I can achieve it answer is also a personal leave experience if you may allow I want to share that with you tell me share my mother is now a school principal but she was a school teacher earlier and I always had this fantasy that why is it such a big difference between the private schools and the public schools so I used to time and again asked when I was a kid maybe when I was in class 8th and 9th why do we see so much of a difference and then she used to tell me that it is also because and then I used to ask why can't you bring this change in that change then she said that we are at the last leg and it is the administrator who have this sort of decision making power so that also made my believe stronger that this is platform where I can serve and have a life in public service passionate about joining the civil services and you have interacted with your mother I have come to know that the public service have the last thing in the say in the matter once you get and your posted as in course of time you are posted at principal secretary education in the state of Haryana what changes will you recommend to the government for the system which you have seen through your mother to improve that system sir firstly I would want I believe in the idea that the primary Education should be Universal this should be vocalisation of Secondary Education and specialisation in the tertiary education secondly say I think in the state of Haryana the teachers are also involved in a lot of second tertiary work for example we have a scheme known as the Parivar pahchan Patra which also takes a lot of teachers time so in my humble opinion I would want teachers to focus exclusively on teaching and not do other administrative work that is something I would want to change I would think I think we need to focus on employability and element skills of the 21st century I think we need to start teaching them to children at a very young age for example like coding like awareness about artificial intelligence these sort of things I think even I as a child studying in Chandigarh in a good schools we will not exposed to these skills and I think these are the relevant skills of the modern world how the new education policy of 2020 as the address these concerns which have expressed just some of the sum of the things which have mentioned are already done in the national education policy 2020 like vocation and universalisation of primary education and some sort of new skills and I think the implementation is the major part of it but I think the exposure to modern ideas like artificial Intelligence and coding I think it is not addressed to that extent in the new education policy I don't know if it is only with the state of Haryana that we said we see the teachers are involved in other work I think the teachers also do the Sensex work so I think that is also an additional problem because these days teachers are over burden sir so I would want also has to do this census was also if not police personal some other category of government employee anyway what you mean by the population education population at a population scale or it can mean education about population dynamics education about population about education in conversation due to that only what is ghost classes as you are so keen into education are you aware of this as far as I can recall it is those classes in which teachers are not present on the not taking the class students recently cop 28 Summit took place right so what are the major takeaways of cook 28.83 in Dubai first is that we finally address the problem of fossil fuels ok to come together for industrial transition elements thirdly we have made loss and damage fund 43 Mein finally come together to the idea of adaptation and have a significant amount of money put towards it now adaptation for climate adaptation fund and will the country is committed to put in 100 billion dollars towards it but it was not done so and they have created that tell me what is carbon capture if you are aware of this then what is carbon capture is it really going to mitigate and to fight with the climate change I don't think so carbon capture basically means capturing the carbon dioxide from the environment from the environment and placing it as solid carbon in the limestone reserves or any other place in my humble opinion I think carbon capture is not the way to it can always towards better policies of 80 but I don't personally believe in the idea of jio engineering if we have to do carbon capture we should always do it through afforestation what is scheme of the government to conserve wetlands if I am not wrong wetlands are land masses covered with water more or less about their for example even paddy fields are considered wetlands how is wetland different from mangrove plants are freshwater areas and mangroves are saline water areas and mangoes occur in the internet ideal solutions and can occur anywhere and the most important to conserve wetlands and mangrove forest department biodiversity thirdly they are also drivers towards blue green instructor which is very important in today's organisation I think they can we can be drivers towards better tourisms at the same time at the same time we can provide aesthetic value that is what I can what do you understand by minimum wage and living wage so we are with what India is still going with minimum wage or Living wages minimum wage is the floor amount set by the government which is to be paid to any labour is broader concept which deals with the deals with how much money a person required how much will a person requires to have a decent standard of living so it may be above the minimum wage or it may be below the minimum age and I think in India we follow the minimum wages I would like to know your opinion on menstrual leave today granted to women or what is your stand or it should be left like that I think menstrual leave should be granted to women it should not but at the same time it should not be granted as some sort of Charity or some sort of sympathy I think it anyone requires a break and we shouldn't put a double burden on anyone at the at this point of time at the same time it doesn't make remain in period so a menstrual leave but it should also be complemented with other sources of paternal leaves required by parents my father like the eternally you are from Haryana can you give me a snapshot of disputes that Haryana has with its neighbouring States Haryana has an issue Haryana to issue with Punjab first is the syl issue and second is the issue of Chandigarh second one I think Haryana has a land dispute with Himachal over the Parmanu region thirdly there is there was a recent there are two three reasons curves with Rajasthan one was about about about about about mob lynching case in which happened which involved people from Haryana happened in Haryana I'm not exactly aware of it was a small newspaper headlines and fourth fourth is the issue of Haryana with New Delhi it's over the sharing of water because Haryana has to give certain amount of water to New Delhi and Haryana itself is scarcity of water in dry region so I think that is an issue with New Delhi one of the highest in the country what are the reason 5.2% unemp unemployment rate is by the CMI survey so there can be two three reasons to it I think first is that CMI survey has a smaller sample space and at the same time it possible error of Surveying and actually unemployment is not there according to me if a national survey comes in and there is a private server I tend to believe with the plf service in India as a nation unemployment rate is one of the highest what do you have to say about the same also applied to the state of Haryana so these issues first of employability I think unemployment is a smaller ratio and employability is a bigger issue because these days we are saying that a lot of youth has the necessary but they don't have the necessary skill so the private place is not interested to higher them that is one I think the second problem is that there is a demand supply mismatch so Areas where there point I want to move on to next question which is that you wanted to use you just mention it to my colleague that you want to make impact to the society and I read in your dad that your father does social service and is active in politics is in politics a better medium to make an impact as compared to Civil Services I mean maybe that would have been easy for you to do your young people and anyway not coming into politics in India Civil Services is easier for me because I have good academic command services requires a academic command as the primary condition and that is not the condition required in civil services so it is a strength I want to use in civil services at the same time politician politics is a good way to serve the society but personally I believe that there are many variable an politics of the society at a larger level there is the issue but ultimately it is the permanent permanent executive which takes up those issues ok my last question to you would be tell me the biggest failure of your life till now have you ever failed in life of course but I can't see I am very lucky unfortunate to not have anything big as failure in my life experience I feel the mains exam last year and I feel a lot of debate when I was a kid and I used to debate a lot so that are failures but at that time I was very arrogant that why did I feel but over time I realiza is that because as you rightly mention I think I have little Experience so maybe that's why I couldn't understand things in totality so that is my failure you have under your service preference you have mentioned Foreign Services as 21st rank why is it so you have studied globalisation and all those things still IFS is so low why because I have debated in school and I also studied Political Science and international relations analyse that I don't have that much gain interest in it that I should pursue it is a life long career that was one reason second I think Foreign Services and eventually prestigious service but I want to serve my country by staying in India and in Foreign Services you have to stay outside the country for considerable amount of time so that's a personal choice ok you have been selected as best parliamentarian in your parliamentarian debate kind of Championship according to you I mean who are the parliamentarians of India can you name a few in your opinion there are two three I can recall right now I think Atal Bihari Vajpayee was a great parliament area second I think Sitaram mutually is a great parliament area but why I mean just one or two reasons I think in my opinion I believe that a parliament area should have two three qualities First they should go above the party lines and discuss what are the important issues without politicization at least the National Association their constituency and they should be participate in debates and be present in Parliament during sessions and thirdly sir I think they should follow the decorum of the Parliament recently record number of parliamentarians have been expelled from the house what is your take on it sir I think it's a combined failure and I have two three points to it in terms of the points of the opposition there are two three things I think the opposition has the agenda to policies the issues even the issues which require debate and deliberation that is first reason secondly I think said the practice of disruptions has gained traction in the opposition and I think they find it convenient to convenient to use it in terms of the tragedy I think they also have faith firstly I think on bigger issues and they also find it convenient that they can run the Parliament like this and this focus more on quantity then qualities that is the thing and I think there is systemic issues also said that the Indian parliament is designed in such a way that the government gets too much power in deciding the agenda of the house I think that creates a problem I think the anti lowest created a lot of problem right you are from Haryana has two wonderful distinctions one is positive that it has one of the highest per capita income State wise in India what there is another one which is very some which is the lowest child sex ratio so is there any correlation between the two with you then the economic prosperity which came in Haryana was not congruent with the social development so I think this is not a correlation person but we can always say that as the society progressed material and they became very liberal material they couldn't evolve this social norms accordingly right you have also studied taxation systems of India right in indirect tax we have certain reforms like GST indirect taxes do we have any kind of reforms or any Reform on the annual the coming reforms I am not particularly as per you any form which is required in direct tax I think about the new tax Regime that is a Reform be made to that people are not compelled to do deductions and they can consume I think the other Reform I think I said I would believe that the compliance should be easier and we have already gone with the faceless mechanism so it is easier but we face some issues regarding the IT portal of direct taxes so I think these sort of things should be removed at the same time in the corporate tax we can do better we can we can improve we can extend the limit of 15% taxation on new entities for the next two three years in my opinion right and what is input tax credit in GST say basically that is why GST that is a market feature of GST that when taxes on the final price we tend to we tend to take benefit of the taxes paid during the intermediate manufacturing so that removes cascading write two of your strengths my first time is that I have good emotional management I am able to understand emotions and I have very good relationship secondly say I think I am a very collaborative person I love to take everyone along and I think I am a team player sure tell me what steps India can take to improve its ranking in ease of doing business index I can think of 34 right now I think sir we have to improve the baby in force property laws and at the same time how property is registered it takes a lot of time and discharges PC required some changes it's a good step but I think we can improve the way it is done for msmes we can make the timeline smaller thirdly I think we can we can provide better loan mechanisms better loans to msmes we are already doing it but this I personally think that still people face a lot of difficulties for the logistics sector has to improve and we have come up with the national logistics policy of 2022 but I think we can take more steps tell me something about subsidies what is a subsidy subsidy is a price subsidy is a price discount paid by the government to reduce the final price of goods and services is there any difference between subsidies and free 20 can be in the form of subsidies but I think all freebies are not personally subsidies because subsidy I think is about reducing the price to make it more affordable but sometimes freebies tend to be in those area where there are affordable but to gain population can you give me some examples of both subsidy is I think we have freebies I think said the Punjab government doesn't take electricity electricity charges from consumers so I think that's a freely and for subsidy I think the Punjab provides Punjab government provides industrial subsidy to a lot of units so that tell me something about Pacific Ring of Fire have you heard of it is Pacific Ring of Fire is a continuous belt which runs in the Pacific and goes on which is an area where a lot of with their two plates colliding and then there are volcanoes because of it ok 90% of the volcanoes are what is the relationship between the plate tectonics and volcanic activity basically when the plates converts so when the plates conversion of their oceanic oceanic plates the subduction of the plate which is denser and that creates a volcanic eruption if there is an Ocean Continental plate like the European plate with the duration plate the we see that then also there is volcanic eruption but when there are Continental plates colliding there is not a volcanic eruption can you give me one example where the area is seismically active but it is not prone to volcanic activity I think now the areas of Himalayas about the L1 mission tell me something about India's mission to monitor the sun's Corona and the plasmic activity and the coronal mass ejection from this l Aditya L1 mission L1 is the lagrange point I think there are three lagrange points between two planetary bodies where the gravitational pull balances each other out and there is no need of too much energy ok fine my final question to you is what are ultra mega Power Projects are not a problem Outsourcing accounting and Finance function what are the advantages of outsourcing accounting and financial functions by the government by the government or private sector I think it reduces conflict of interest so there can be better better financial reporting and true and fair picture of the firms can be presented I think that can happen if we are outsourcing secondary cell we can always minimise the cost and take advantage of cheaper labour and thirdly sir I think it also build scale suppose if you implement this idea in government accounting what could go wrong there are two three things I can think of firstly sir I think a lot of Government data is confidential so that can that can be I think that is a problem secondly sir I think it may lead to some sort of inside a trading and reading that can also happen if it is a government data regarding a PSU or something thirdly sir I think it can also create controversies with the amount with the way the government spend money what is the difference between financial accounting and Management Accounting financial accounting deals with the larger expenditure and revenue part of a firm where is the management accounting deals about the organisational part of it and how the organisation functions and to take accounting into that particular is distinct from IRR is basically the rate at which the net present value of the firm gets to zero so it is an internal rate Roar is a market or a reference rate withdraw from outside and it is a rate at which we discount project to know whether their good or not rrr is borrowed with internal government accounting standards have you heard of this topic is this second and first interview Forbidden in your remains I think I did good but I felt so last year also but this year I change how I write and I extensively improve my knowledge base I think I have done better how was your today's experience it was very good I think the questions were very diverse and I liked it what is assessment your own assessment of your performance and luckily the questions you ask for the questions I knew so that is what I think whatever questions questions we have noticed that on factual questions more focused and more pointed isn't it so that you allow the board member to ask your contact so speak one or two three sentences for sentences and then wait for a reaction that at your performance because you know the subject you can speak at length on subject to try to curve that habit of whenever you feel that that feeling will come to your mind that is going a bit too long not able to express myself in less words that is what I feel good very intellectual help you that will help you otherwise certain areas I am not talking about the positive all all good you are not here to listen to our voice message write down so that you improve your wonderful candidate that I have told you at the very hot site on the quality of your head or heart candidate only thing is like politics a very controversial question was your father was his in politics and you want to simple questions that is I think politics is probably I am not meant for politics is not my cup of something like that instead of delta wants to bragging about one's qualification of aggression that look at me look at my qualification that your results your qualification will speak for itself you need not to boost about that some some element of that aggression was there while you are speaking in this world politics part so you have to work it very cautiously yes isn't it then female is saying that it is not my cup of tea and answer enough not my cup of tea and I think attitude why you don't have attitude why you don't understand service was disturbing things that you have kept at 21 or 22 very honest answer I want to live in India answer 4 number 5 result would have been the same I wanted to be honest about it for I generally don't want to be in the Foreign Service to saying that Foreign Services Nobody's choice yes yes sound like that question may be asked so you said honest about it just work on that what could be more refined way of because Foreign Service is very prestigious service but also for Indian diaspora abroad that is important and very good listener of questions try to give very crisp answers and very balanced also at the same time on any of you is not that you give imbalanced answer anywhere today but keep it somewhere behind the bank of a back of your mind that any contains usual all that don't take any extreme don't take any extreme you just maintain your neutrality isn't it and be your natural self normal self with clarity of purpose and wherever you think that you can show to the board that you can temple of thinking differently out of the box solution isn't it should give go for that water park solution so that is important and those qualities I don't think your interview is going to I am very clear getting Four Points which you have noted today is not criticism is just to tell you that be careful so that just one you will not 1% of error in your interview can I ask did any of you feel that I was not a patient listening because that's a problem which I generally have what happens some people are in love with their voice they want to speak more and more there you have to call your I know you know persons like you are candidates like you that you know enough on anything and everything exuberance to speak out you don't wait for the just wait for the answer to be completed collect your ideas for a while so that it appears to the board also this boy is thinking collecting his ideas and then speaking so that is better way of conversation otherwise nothing fundamental issues and you work on the rough edges and try to sharpen your face then you will do wonderful thank you all the best thank you sir thank you mam
