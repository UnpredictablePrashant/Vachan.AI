what are the environmental concerns with regard to semiconductors do you think that Indian diplomacy is failed in Maldives do you think there is any technical difference between the two terms socialism and communism do you think that somewhere in the name of feminism we are doing too much of Comparison between women and a man should the word secular and socialist be removed from the constitution of India good afternoon please give a brief my name is Hardik Sandeep I am from Vaishali in Ghaziabad I have done my graduation electronics and communication engineering from NIT Kurukshetra answer my hobbies are sketching portraits watching tennis following India Central International relations and sir currently I am serving as a dynamic professional when did you join December 26 December 23 23 December it has just been 3 months so sir I can not suggest to shift from rule based Bureaucracy to railway station also need to be added to switch over from rule based to rule based working is feasible currently administration has become very complex so the Civil servants often have to adapt according to the ground conditions so sir there is discretion while some sort of discretion while implementing the rules as well so civil service is always have to be innovative they have to be Agile and they have to be willing to learn and adapt to the requirements of the working to sir with that respect I think that rule based Bureaucracy is needed Agencies looking at you there is a CBI there is a CVC audit your own internal resistance is very difficult for any bureaucrat to exercise any amount of discretion while taking it is the role of agencies is to ensure that the decisions are taken in a manner but sir I think that if we work with good intentions then sir honest mistakes or are possible but sir they can be said justified however sir if there is some other intention then they people will obviously be caught but I feel that if we do our work with the right intentions and according to the rule book then sir I think that there is no need to fear tell me one of the perception against the Indian Bureaucracy is also a current of this perception and what concrete measures will it take to address minimise corruption is not eliminate it all together transparency in my functioning has to be there for example if any step I am taking it has to be recorded and sir in in terms of my action sir if it is delegated then e-governance can also take place because it also ensures accountability as well and sir there should be a strict sense of integrity in in terms of anything that I am doing so sir I think that minimising discretion increasing transparency and accountability are the steps to ensure that sort of corruption does not take place for vote so what are the basic judgement of the supreme court supreme court and its 1998 decision that earlier even if the MPS or the MLA to buy and and decided to vote upon the drive then sir they were they were protected under article 1054 MPS and 194 for MLA is under parliamentary privileges like those Artic protect them protect any any sort of speech or action that detect within the Parliament but sir now Supreme Court says that this is against the right to equality and sir it puts them it put them on under more scrutiny while giving a boat to sir this will ensure that the vote for the cash for vote does not take place you know what is going to be the fall out of the railway station exercise because we have come a long way since 1971 and population ratio has changed but they are fearful that their number of seat sharing would reduce we can get we can give certain criteria to the present population and certain criteria to the 1971 as the 15th finance commission tried to achieve so there has to be balance sensor it has to be consultative approach including all the stakeholders thank you very much taking training in Delhi can you tell us how many revenue districts we have in Delhi and how many Police stations are there if I am not wrong sir 11 revenue districts are there and sir with respect to police station has divided into divisions subdivisions we have subdivisions also in Delhi sorry do we also have developmental blocks which are units of subdivision and as you take interest in reading about India's International Relation what is the irritant nowadays what is the issue between India and Myanmar 2021 took place in Myanmar and sir the army to control WhatsApp presently there is fighting between the rebellion rebellious groups and the army so sir there are law and order situation due to which the army people are the insurgents are spinning over to the border Indian states where facing internal security troubles in states like Manipur and sir there are some issues on Myanmar and other states as well so we are trying to fence the border and sir we are also contemplating to end the free movement rising the Legislature of Nagaland and Legislature of Mizoram both have passed resolution requesting the central government not to face the border what is their argument and concern that the boundaries were drawn during the colonial times and the people of Nagaland and Mizoram enjoy family ties with people across the border as well so they say that if the if the border is strictly fence then their family would be broken so they are again how many countries we are having fans border with Pakistan we are having Bangladesh and which organisation is responsible to guard the Indo manual border what is the length of this border around 1500 km little more than 1600 ok so is there some religious angle is the ground level ground level some groups in Myanmar having fdt to one religion and the military government there is having different religious Outlook sir I am not exactly sure but the army had his to the Buddhism but the other rebellion groups are there more to the tribal tribal religion or to Christianity Christian border it will be indirectly helpful for the military gym or the Revolutionary groups say it will be helpful for the simulator racing cooperating with government of Myanmar intention is not to corporate with the Rebel salt with the Myanmar is government are intention is to friends so that there is no internal security situation inside a territory ok and do you think that Indian diplomacy is filled in Maldives no sir I don't think so because the internal table Chinese diplomacy is more successful sir any change in political class over there is not in our hands we can only continue with her developmental efforts and said it is natural for small countries in our neighborhood to his between India and China who said the current President is tilting more towards China which has more deeper pockets and does not have to do anything with the ideology they can just come in and plug and play the huge amount of cash that they have WhatsApp utilise our home market better relationship with our neighbouring countries for the products of neighbouring countries today in enforcement of safta so there are certain issues with respect to software sir one is that we the kind of goods that we are producing we are producing areas are producing their complementary like there are they are not complementary and their similar kind of products such as there is often competition with respect to them and because India has better manufacturing capability survival has not come to fusion because of India Pakistan dispute due to that relationship this is why we are making our neighbours more and more dependent on other countries I feel that we have given Pakistan enough chances answer why we are isolating Nepal and Bhutan in Bangladesh talking with respect to them as well ok as you are born in Delhi you studied in school in Ghaziabad and your parents comes from Uttar Pradesh but you have claimed that you are domicile of Haryana how can I have done my graduation in Haryana for 4 years ago student of political science how do you define the Missile sir where we have spent more than 6 months at a place it can be considered as a domestic officially that your domicile of spend more than 4 years over there so that is why only spending time is enough condition or some registration required you have Political Science as your optional subject right can you please tell me in terms of or in context of you know parliamentary proceedings when we see when we say the bill has been passed by a what does that mean there has to be voting with respect to any bill that has to be passed so said the chairman takes the opinion of the members present there to sir if there is outright majority in favour of the bill so he first asked that members in favour of the bill can say I and others in favour of no other is not in favours can say no sorry if there is clear clearly the majorities in favours the answer it can be said that the bill has been passed by boys is the voting in that context recorded or it is simply the discretion of the presiding officer decides on the decibel of the people who are saying either in favour of the bill or against the bill that he takes a call with this bill you know qualifies to be passed or not passed with it has the consent of the members or otherwise what is the mechanism it is recorded but if the chairman is clear that there is quite a number of difference between those things yes and no then he can say that it is passed by Sir ok ok so since there has been vacancy in Rajya Sabha elections are going on to fill up the vacancies in Rajya Sabha system for Rajya Sabha is the seats are allocated to different states in terms of proportion of population right so the states Which are which are having large population are given in a larger representation for those States which are strictly following the population control measures I mean following population control measures their population will come down and accordingly their representation in the house of elders will go down do you think this particular thing is in sync with the idea for many years representation with respect to the 1971 census and it has been deleted till 2026 so after that there has to be some consideration and deliberation with the southern States as well and I feel that there has to be mix of the current the ratio has to be mix of the current scenario and the 1971 level ok since you have studied political science me let me dissolve my personal doubt you know rudimentary understanding of Marxism suggest that you know this Communism and socialism both are same thing as it as a subject expert do you think there is any technical difference between the two terms socialism and communism socialism is a transitory face and communism is the ultimate stage where the private property would be abolished socialism is one is a time where the larger section of the society that is the Florida rates those are the workers they will be the decision making body and the decision should be implemented on the board of class and for the sections of society Communism is one where private property and classes and so there has to be collective decision making are used for overflow of capitalism socialism comes and after social combination based on your understanding of the concept do you think that Communism is a philosophical idea it is a idealistic stage where as socialism is something that can be achieved during the process yes sir I feel that Communism is a Utopian Idea and sir it has no where been fully achieved in the history as well because sir after a socialism has been achieved the power mostly concentrated in the hands of few people and because they have a vested interest the complete transition of power does not take place one hypothetical question from my side one case is pending I mean the matter is subject and before the division bench of High Court of Delhi the matter pertains to question of law with regard to interpretation of the Constitution can the division bench of High Court decide on the merit of the case does it have the locus of standard to decide the merit of the case as it pertains to interpretation of the constitution what is the strength of constitution bench of Supreme Court five members if the five member constitution bench has decided on any subject with regard to interpretation of the Constitution is there any possibility that the same decision can be appealed against if yes with which bench and what will be the composition of that bench in terms of number Yes sir it can be appealed and it can be appealed towards the larger bench for example if the decision was given by 5 judgements then only seven or more decisions of lower courts including the high courts of India can be appealed by way of special leave petition is there any exception that certain in a judgement delivered by certain in a course of tribunals as such decisions cannot be appealed under special repetition of 136 of Indian constitution the military force cannot be appealed and special quotes special quotes have constituted to decide any you know set of issue can that decision also be appealed and Supreme Court Hardik what do you understand by men's right and women's rights are claims over something like any state or society has to give people certain right so that they can deliver dignified life so my claim over something is my right can be certain rights over their body or over their lives which helps which helps them to labour dignified life do you think that somewhere in the name of feminism we are bringing too much of Comparison between women and women stands for equality of women equality of rights and opportunities for men and women and it's not about comparison the comparison eminence because in our society the women have traditionally seen as inferior to men but because they are voicing their demands and rights more so it might feel that way so that means the rights to men have been guaranteed right from the beginning and certain rights have not been given to women so that is why their voice in their for their rights there are no infringement of rights as per as for men explicitly like there are certain restrictions on men as well for example if someone wants to become a safe I guess then he might feel some resistance from his family members or if someone wants to choose a profession where where he or she is not seen as like ideal in the society then they face resistance like what is the context and what is the going through Hardik when we see a society you know as it's largely divided on the basis of class I am not talking about cast right on the economic basis if we talk right so there have been upper class lower class middle class lower middle class rate and there has been quite divide between rich and the poor and we all know that there is inequality but there is yet another understanding of ultra rich so why this is happening in our country in a society that the rise of ultra rich is Getting higher and the poor among the poorest is again what could be done from the business backgrounds or those who have inherited portion of wealth while the poor or the middle class are often salary employees which have only a particular bandwidth of salaries so it for them to rice and my country has taken several steps in that regard as well for example we started with Land Reforms then we did Bank nationalization be abolished the previous pulses and currently we are taxing the Ultra rich are also tagged very high and we are giving subsidies to the poor we are creating job opportunities in the manufacturing sector for them and we are creating we are creating opportunities for the foreign direct investments to come so that specialisation manager in specialisation and job opportunities are there so I think we are taking several steps and because we are free society and we are also giving freedom is of doing business as well so we cannot stop someone's growth we can only provide a similar equality of opportunity for all together feeling after a period of three or four years that startups are Lin and 90% of the startups fail naturally but after the covid-19 pandemic a bubble was created because a lot of funding was there for the startups during the covid-19 but after that may be due to the corporate governance that was not right in terms of certain startups like the byju's or over estimation of the market or due to the shortage of funds across the world there is a lack of funding for new startups as well so there are different reasons for different startups that are feeling what do you understand development is one where women not only lead a certain social change but they are also the benefits of of that since there is they have access to resources they have control over their own lives and they can they feel empowered to bring some change in the society so it's a very Holistic sketching human portraits what is its uses especially in terms of my official capacity sketching can be used to send a signal to wider sections of the society like many people may not be able to read or write a certain language but they are all of an attracted by sketches or paintings and I'm in my personal capacity to all often helps me relax or it often helps me to get a perspective that whatever might be the different the different ways I take to make a sketch but the end result is what that that is important you would like to highlight through your sketches the importance of sports in our society is quite underrated so I feel that the sports person in our country needs to be lionised and they need to be they need to be made popular shows of famous sports personality and their and two or three lines about them can increase awareness about the sports person thank you Hardik Hardik what is the welfare state so welfare state is one which takes care of its people and their aspirations and sir the state is involved in the distribution of public goods like education Healthcare and to provide a decent level of living to all can you think of some of the social indicators that can be used to differentiate a welfare state from a police state these indicators from a citizens perspective so one can be the happiness index like the police state can only ensure the security but not the prosperity of the well being of the people sir another one another one can be said the Human Development Index where the education health standards and life expectancy is also measured inside the gender disparity index can also be one criteria because police state is over concerned about its own increase in tenure and not about a particular gender or something like that ok I'll give you scenario if a particular country is studying increasing its difference and internal security expenditure can it be seen as a move towards inclination towards a police state no sir it is not necessary because our increase in the defence budget can also depend upon an internal security challenges for example from the insurgents or the mouse or something like that answer with for example in Europe as well because the external environment is such that countries like Germany are increasing their defence budget by more than 100 billion dollars due to thread from Russia to the are also doing that because only when the borders are secure and people are assured of growth in the future will prosperity will be there is one where non elected people have control over the Institutions and the way in which the government runs and said they are often behind the behind the first side of representative government for example said the Pakistan army is called as deep state we have seen a lot of debate and discussion around the restrictions imposed on entry to certain temples so what is your restricted entry to certain temples so according to you should temples be made open to everyone or should they be allowed to decide on the eligibility criteria for who can enter and who can not enter the temples law can only be while lock and suggest a top down approach with regard to a step but people can accept it only when there is consensus among them and said every Temple represents certain customs traditions of the people answer if it is imposed then it will only allow prot answer restrictions on so I think that whatever decision is taken there must be consensus amongst the local people that their views and opinions are also taken into account while taking allowing entry or not allowing entry that a particular temple or a religious institution subscribes to a particular ideology which districts people from certain community or maybe a certain gender from entering the temple so which should be given primacy the right of those individuals who are not being allowed to enter the temple or the right of the religious Institutions the Supreme Court has said that not allowing a particular section to enter a temple can be a form of untouchability so Supreme Court has allowed entry of women into the Sabarimala but sir still the people over there are not acceptable of that because Sabarimala also has certain historical quantity competition for the local people so I think that until and unless there is a informed discussion and debate among the local people division on the ground is difficult to change final question to you should the word secular and socialist be removed from the constitution of India no sir I don't feel so because we are a secular country and survey give equal respect and support to all already have provisions related to religious freedom under fundamental rights what difference will it make if we remove the word secular from the constitution there has to be explicit understanding that we are a secular and socialist country because at the end the steps that we take a driven by the ideals like socialist secular and sovereign and the other ideas that are given in the Preamble and sir because the Preamble is a summary of The Identity card of the Constitution so I feel that they cannot be a difference between what is under the constitution and what is represented in the Preamble thank you India has been trying to become a global hub for semiconductors design manufacturing or technology development so what steps the government has taken so far in this direction so under the PLI scheme we are providing designed link intensive design linked incentive scheme where we are providing 50% of the capital outlay for any company that wants to establish semiconductor heavier and said there are several other schemes like specs that is scheme for promotion of electric electronic components and semiconductors there are also electronic manufacturing clusters as well so sir along with the survey are also given support to the startups that are coming across in this sector what is the spoke about PLI what is in 14 Sector so DNA is specifically with respect to the Electronic sector and service stands for design linked incentive scheme what are the environmental concerns with regard to semiconductor it requires uninterrupted of water and power so there has to be consideration where the the fabrication plants have been set up that is one ends are also with respect to a disposal there has to be detailed study of the post usage life of the semiconductors and they do not cause any harm to the environment due to leakage or seepage into water 19 March selected in 21 22 answer it was only on the second day so I was not prepared for the random questions is very difficult to say what we interview will go predict about that it may be 100% based on your deaf it may again be a quiet random also but you see your a student of Political Science and you are already probably some questions relating to your area of work because Although we have only underground training for last 3 months only so it's very difficult for you to get a feel of civil services what is still you can't stop members from Asking questions so your training module and issues where you can suggest anything of course that you have only three months into service or not in a position to give you but something adding working of functioning of the government will definitely be there what were the questions will be asked to be difficult but then generally perception of corruption red tapism government Wings slow in its delivery and all that so and your ideas basically just exit your opinion for water what is going to be your thought process to address to ask you a few questions so read update your information about what about the constitutional development have taken place not only the context of the larger context of abrogation of article 370 and all that and the few judgements which have been delivered by the supreme court implications rising out of the conclusion that is very important so I am not going to all those details about international relationship with particularly with the neighbouring countries and elections are happening in many countries and all that your loving countries have told you then elections are likely to take place in the USA also us selection is also very important to follow it also Republic Day candidates and all that and process leading to the final voting and all that that should be known to you of government democratic form of Government the prime minister which will you support why will you support and all that rule and rule I have already asked to you are from the political science issues between the Government of all those issues which have happened in the recent past four five issues are there and the intervention of Supreme Court and those should be known to be very clearly then about the Student Of Electronics government is trying to push electronics sector in the country and you spoke about the clusters and all that so what is the concept of SDM AMC modified special incentive package is also then what is that Rakesh electronic development fund also what is the purpose of that fund the policy of make in India to 16 and the electronic Policy was also cursory glance of that and semiconductor is important issue issues with the environmental issue is one issue but what are the issue supply chain management and all that light theory all those issues are there regarding this and then there is a network readiness index also I don't know whether you are aware of that are network index related to your area of this thing only go back and read about that does India stand as per the latest ranking and what are the parameters are there in some areas we have been very well and some areas lot of boy from UP lot of questions on use range of questions the development of your defence Industrial corridors and all that is needed for that and what is the present status of that and River Ganga is an issue so pollution in River Ganga what is the Namami Gange project and all that then you are from Ghaziabad to compare the two districts of Ghaziabad with your neighbouring district of Gautam Buddha Nagar that is also why why Gautam Buddha Nagar is Ghaziabad is not not as developed as Gautam Budh Nagar and the two districts contribution to the gsdp of Uttar Pradesh there is also important told you what all initiatives have been taken by the government of Uttar Pradesh so as to give front how it is really going up and all that what are the reasons for that investment and all which are the best friends are taking place for International Airport is coming up India what is the PPP model on which the centre for airport I should cover and you have already secured 187 you are capable of securing 187 190 absolute no problem just keep your head on your shoulder and maintain your integrity absolute integrity and honesty of purpose while giving answers and try to give very expenses ok once you have able to catch the central theme of the question you will be able to give you are not argument download
