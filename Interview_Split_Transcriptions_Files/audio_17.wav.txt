what do you mean by the shear zone how do you visualise the future of India in coming AI age tell me why did India lose World Cup I am sure you must have analysed it will tell me about two of your weaknesses which can be a hindrance for you becoming a Civil Servant tell me some of the steps that have been recently taken to enhance India's border security thank you sir please give a brief introduction about yourself good morning Sar my name is kaabil Bhargav I belong to Kanpur and we have four members in the family my father is a chartered accountant my mother is a housewife and my sister is doing a graduation from BITS Pilani I have done my graduation in BITS Pilani in civil engineering and I passed out in 2018 currently I am working as an assistant executive engineer in Central Public Works Department in Ministry of housing and urban affairs I play badminton in cricket my other hobbies include learning civil engineering softwares you're not happy while working in the CPWD I am happy you want to join the civil services civil services will offer me a diverse array of challenges which in which I can apply my civil engineering knowledge and my work experience in the government department till now and also it will help in ok you are a Civil Engineer you have passed out from BITS Pilani you said in civil engineering question how do you balance environmental concerns socio economic considerations when planning and executing a civil engineering project for environmental concerns we are looking at sustainability or the various alternatives which could give the best option among for this we are doing the environmental impact assessment and for the social dimension we are involving the community telling the benefits of this project and also conducting social impact assessment wonderful what do you mean by management Risk Management related to a construction project refers to the environment the economic as well as other social risk related to the which might hamper in its effective functioning as well as during the construction and post construction phase what is the difference between Quality Control and Quality Assurance security Assurance refers to the term where in we measure the quality at the end of the project while handing it over to the client so at that time the various parameters like finishing or the strength of the structure are measured quality control is a continuous and ongoing process which happens during the project so that we streamline the various processes whether they are done correctly or not and it is also it also involves the post construction during the maintenance phase as well so that the experience of living and the safety parameters and the optimise functioning of the building is taken into consideration recent Pro committee also which has come out with certain recommendations so first question is what are the reasons as per the committee's report for the collapse of the tunnel that I haven't been through the report but if you may allow me I can state what could have been the possible go ahead so one could be the slope stability where they were constructing the tunnel second could be the water seepage of the water drainage is shown in the Tunnel that could be the seismic or the land like the natural factors which would have taken the earth below or above the tunnel which could have led to the collapse others could be including human errors or may be planning not not getting actual evidence of the strength of the support structure of the time what do you mean by the share with respect to Foundation the shear zone is the zone which holds the foundation of giving strength the shear strength to the foundation to transfer the loads from the structure to the ground level when and how an alignment could go wrong sir alignment could go on to due to various reasons like rise in water table could be one reason for foundation alignment going round or differential settlement could be another reason liquefaction could be one reason shear stress becomes zero due to normal stress is rising increase civil engineer right so tell me what are green corridor systems and how much it is working in India and what are the way ahead green corridor is refers to road construction and infrastructure construction which incorporate green measures Open Spaces as well as during their alignment like let's say there is a passage in a infrastructure project which is empty we can we can plant trees in those areas I am asking green corridor system is it related to some temporary route which is without traffic lights and which has some other purpose to be served I think you are confusing It with Greenfield projects which are taken up in areas where there was no previous infrastructure so they are constructed and Open Spaces and they are used for that purpose see you are an Engineer also so how do you visualise the future of India in coming AI age the country optimise their different services in engineering as well so we can use it for predictive analysis even monitoring can be done by AI strategic planning and immersive Technology can be used for training of the staff it will help in the precession and accuracy of the projects we are delivering source code you can interact with the learning language module you can answer you can make queries to the software you can get responses how this chat what is at present it is different from the older ones on machine learning advantages facing right now is a lot of users are using the dishoom more and more data analysis and its refinement is been done in charge GPT so it like if its using its machine learning module so it's getting more data so it is able to better perceive the outcome for a new response ok so it has been said that if the incidence after 2021 has happened it cannot respond to such incidents or such questions or queries which has been asked through it just right concept in Environmental Engineering Works teams are made related to a product or a process so that they are measured as sustainable whereas they are not for example the Volkswagen diesel Gate scandal was one of the instances of green washing the screen washing term has actually been come where the scope 28 took place in took place in Dubai are you aware of some of the takeaways tell me to minimum the major takeaways are the loss and damage fund ok and the other is the Global stocktake which was supposed to happen 8 years after the Paris agreement there are pledges regarding the Global cooling then there are measures for unabated desktop in the harmful subsidies related to fossil fuels also taken for tapping carbon if I put my last question and which is again related to Clean Energy so how is this bio CNG is Bible these days and how it is going to be gender inclusive uses the Methane Gas with combined with compressed natural gas so I think it is sustained it is a sustainable alternative because it can be used it can be generated from the waste to energy plants as well that is one thing how it can be gender inclusive is maybe it can help in rural areas for where people are collecting firewood a cow dung this can be used for rural day to day activities as well thank you Uttar Pradesh tell me why is Uttar Pradesh opposing car services but maybe it would divide the society on cast lines further where we are moving towards inclusive society leaders from Uttar Pradesh would include the Yadav community leaders which are part of the OBC any other tribal leaders from Uttar Pradesh have a lot many tribal leaders any idea it's ok I see you have interest in cricket tell me how many umpires do we have in cricket we have four empires in do you have any fifth Empire also I haven't heard of maybe 5th comprises referred to as the match referee or the technology in cricket ok tell me why did India lose World Cup I'm sure you must have analysed at there are a couple of reasons apart from the general reasons like it was a bad day and all I think toss played a major factor in the final culture that's coming up in cricket one factor could be attributed to IPL regarding the workload management of the players The Other could be that IPL is like the T20 format is moving the players towards like not building the enough and playing more like more faster brand of cricket so they could not consolidate their entire 50 overs that could be one reason that the debt to GDP ratio will go more than 100% why do you think we are getting such kind of warnings the covid-19 pandemic the government had to take up a counter cycle fiscal policy so the date of the country has been increasing but as per the RBI and the government I don't think this is a cause of worry because considering our growth rate in terms of GDP and the investments were receiving in a share market and normal mos the dead should be in control of we might be able to service adopt in sustainable fashion tell me a situation where you had to work with the colleague that was get on with how did you manage that situation there have been instances in project designing where all of us have not been on the same played so at the at those things we take references to the codal provisions or we talk to our seniors on what could be the best way to get out to get out of the situation so I think if I am not able to work with a colleague there are two ways you refer to the rules which are the Coral provisions or you take some advice from a senior please tell me the last time that you cried after seeing the man's result this time you are from Kanpur right tell us something interesting about Kanpur is delicious that is one interesting thing which is not recognise the sweets and all shaadi things in Kanpur include the IIT Kanpur the Ganga Barrage the Kanpur Central railway station and the newly formed Kanpur Metro and something more interesting about like Kanpur jokes and all those I mean tobacco industry of Kanpur tobacco industry is famous there are Jokes related to Pan and all but I don't think it is that scale with popular in that skill in Kanpur why it is so that I been so many big stars are endorsing these tobacco Industries What is so special about it social acceptance and the consumer base of the industries products 5 service preference you have opted zone 1 as your first preference write is up which is coming state is Delhi right so I have taken up as my first preference not taking my home state as the first preference so why is it so because of the familiarity for the reason I am flexible to work in any part of the country but given a preference I have taken Uttar Pradesh as my first preference right fine and you are also civil engineer fine you are working in Ministry of housing and Urban Development right what are the flagship schemes of your ministry of the Smart City project the second housing for all scheme is 1 what is the target year for housing for initially the target was 2022 but now it has been moved 2024 tell me one thing that all the spendings on these housings whether they come under capital expenditure or revenue expenditure so they would come under capital expenditure how so because we are creating an asset which could be used for further like purposes for people staying there and then working it is used it is it is seen as an investment and why it is so important to spend on infrastructure for economic development of a country has a multiplier effect on various other sectors as well and also involves in from the private borrowers at the same time so if you make an infrastructure it will give you long term returns in terms of its logistics reducing the logistics cost for setting up industries in those areas that you will also have improved services access to social health care and education in the area of the target of UP is to become 1 trillion dollar economy by 20383 so as per your opinion what steps the government should be taking I mean government of UP should be taking to reach this goal as soon as possible the first would be signing more use and converting them into actual projects which would increase the investment as well as the employment opportunities for the state the second is the infrastructure development the third would be focusing on the human development indicators as well where we are lagging so focus should be on like there is one scheme of setting of one medical college for distance that is a step in the right direction other long term suggestions could be working on the education sector so that we have a employable workforce and which could flourish in the entrepreneur segmental you have also mentioned that you have played badminton yes and got some gold medal also at college level right in recent years we have seen that India is doing quite well in badminton price so many medals at international level so what are the reasons behind it badminton has benefited from The Legacy left by Prakash Padukone sir and Pullela Gopichand sir so that has had inspired the masses and those ages so grassroot development in badminton had started in at those times but now the infrastructure supporting badminton as well as conducting a privately the premier Badminton League opening up infrastructure for international competitions as well and the awareness among the people are reasons IC India is doing well and we also have now good National International courses giving their I will tell me about two of your weaknesses which can be a hindrance for you becoming a Civil Servant so when would be the non ability to say no so maybe during work also I trivialize like if more time to certain trivial things which I am trying to work upon for civil services when it comes to India's border security two of the terms are very frequently in news one is LOC and the other one is lac so can you tell me something about these two terms additionally tell me how these two are different from the International border LOC is a term for use between the India Pakistan border line of control it is agreement between the two militaries where they had agreed to see his fire by the intervention of a third party LIC is the line of actual control it is not demarcated it is used with the border of China border with China it is not demarcated and we have a buffer zone in that area which both the countries are patrolling and we are like the troops are station on their side the International border is a mutually agreed border which is accepted by both the parties and the Global community at large so it is a settled water which we have with all the other neighbours so tell me some of the steps that have been recently taken to enhance India's border security Prime Minister development initiative in the Northern region is one initiative second we are building border roads at the first space technological improvement of the military services so that they can station that troops in cold temperature areas as well the other is the joint force command based on the geographical which will have more coordinated action Border Security coming to coastal security as well so we have given powers to Indian Coast Guard and we have been giving like missile technology to the Indian Navy fine have you heard about the BS norms for the automobile industry what are these norms BS norms refers to the Bharat stage norms which control the emission of various pollutants like Sulphur Dioxide nitrogen oxide and particulate matter from the emission of the vehicular exhaust we are currently moving to bs6 skipping the bs5 so that we have a cleaner air so why did India decide to skip bs5 directly switching from BS4 to bs6 because their concerns regarding the air quality retreating in the country so we decided to skip BS4 and move to bs6 which are more closer to the European standards so you must have heard that there has been an ongoing debate between the old pension scheme and the new pension scheme so can you tell me some differences between the two old pension scheme the entire burden of the pension is on the government your last drawn salary 50% of that you will be getting for your pension period but in the new pension scheme the burden lies on the employee as well so fixed percent like 10% is cut from your basic salary and it is contributed to a Pension Fund which investment securities as well as share market depending on that you will get the final pension amount so my last question to you is currently we are witnessing an exponential increase in the number of Web portals and mobile applications for the purpose of credit lending can you tell me how these Agencies or participants are being regulated RBI has given regulation norms for these entities for the digital lending activities they directly do not lend the loans they partner with the bank or another credit giving agency and they use their network the network to give loan so they are being regulated by the RBI through their partner banks so where is essentially the lending money coming from is it coming from the commercial banks or these participants are lending out by their own it is coming from the partner Bank what is the meaning of your name what initiatives have been taken by the government to prevent pollution in Ganga at Kanpur the construction of the Ganga Barrage maintaining a more than low blood flow in the system setting up of women treatment effluent plants for the leather as well as the textile industries so that reflects not done there the third is the progress made in the solid waste management and setting up of waste to energy plants other measures could be implementing the Namami Gange project at a good speed in the Kanpur stage so do you really think that Ganga is clean and now at Kanpur thank you very much talking to you know which item is this for you it's my third time and for interview this time this time results are not I have given the means we have given the means how was your experience today it was good I was a bit nervous because it's my first interview after a long time so what is your assessment of performs not good why it's not good could not answer certain basic questions like the green corridor vertical was a bit more could repeat statements after sometime that was one thing to worry about the interview very good personality every week humble and polite person that is what is required for maintain your sincerity honesty of purpose of the interview so wherever you did know about the green corridor system and all that so in the world very first place when you think that you would be able to answer such a question admit that you don't know honesty is the best policy you know I don't so many things you don't know this also you don't know that matter but don't speak on any subject without knowing it is not very balanced views very focused expenses you give all those good qualities are there good thing is that password from a prestigious Institute rabbits Pilani read something about the BITS Pilani and all that and other VIT Mishra ji compare with VIT Mishra and all that what comparisons what difference between the two institutes that is important in you is that you have taken Azure optional subject which is your core area is very often many candidates don't do what you have taken up that courage and you have come out with God good marks in civil engineering lot of questions regarding civil engineering pertaining to governance may be issued try to touch on certain issues like environmental clearance issue is there what is environmental assessment what is social assessment impact assessment of questions in CPWD so flagship projects we ask you green buildings and all that what is the concept what are the examples where CPU has constructed buildings and all that two example idea about civil engineering knowledge by the interview regarding business and all that so lot of Mega bridges we have constructed in all that so well Foundation is different from pile foundation and where you recommend going for a well Foundation which river with the perennial river this kind of thing and maybe asked incidentally green corridor system which we tried to get answer from you is not related to Civil Engineering it is your basically organisations related to Civil Engineering humbly you can ask the concerned about think you are referring to this then if you are not that is one thing and otherwise we didn't find any problem when you entered your entered as a confident person use don't taking permission from US to permission then listen it should be when you entered I think your buttons were open of similarly while right you are going to wear this dress only for serious problem so therefore suggestion from our side just have believe in yourself just keep your head on your shoulder to give very balanced answers on contentions issues if I talk you are asked and even if you are pushed to the wall don't bug or buckle under pressure because these are the points which is the board will like to see you with what are the personality traits in you whether you buckle under pressure or whether you get valid by the board members questions and all that don't be argument listener of questions try to understand intent of the question before speak very good marks in the range of examination written examination enter the board with Radiance on your face smile on your face and stay like that energy level should be high all the best from outside any specific question if you have in your mind to ask us all the best thank you thank you thanks thanks thanks thanks
