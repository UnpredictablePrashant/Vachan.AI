why there is a reluctance to take up a teaching as the First Choice career have you heard of shark Yamini yes sir tell me something about which philosophy ancient philosophy also used to believe that in animate objects also have soul or Atma can you tell me the background of this particular case and what was the ruling in this case what is the difference between CPI Urban and rural why two different sets of consumer price index good morning good morning good morning please give a brief introduction about yourself my name is Shreya shakya and I am from Mainpuri Uttar Pradesh and I've done my 12th from Mainpuri and then I moved on to Delhi and I did my graduation from Sri Guru Teg Bahadur Khalsa College of Delhi University thereafter I also did my post graduation from Hansraj College Delhi University and currently I am pursuing my B.Ed program and also preparing for UPSC to take up teaching as the First Choice teaching is also one of my preference as a career option but I have always wanted to be a Civil Servant so and teaching I keep it as my plan B candidates like you keep it as a plan B that is what my question is I want to try once I want to try for the Civil Servant services ok tell me you have studied zoology isn't it may have been hearing about human animal conflict in animal conflict what are the reasons broadly 23.0 share with us what are the reasons for the conflict yes sir man animal conflict we generally we are hearing its in Kerala the elephant attacks and all the reason I think is we are destroying the habitats of the animals like because of the development we are going for deep into the forest for certain infrastructure projects like Highway disturbing the habitat of the animal this is the first reason then another reason is some other reasons could be invasive species because of the invasive species animal tends to come out of the forest Wildlife Protection Act Kerala wants amendment in the Wildlife Protection at what exactly is the demand of the Government of Kerala sir I am not aware of that ok what is the study of animal behaviour is called study of animal behaviour specifically I don't know what is the significance of photosynthesis in Marine ecosystem photosynthesis photosynthesis is generally performed by the phytoplanktons and then the other organisms like algae which are present importance would be managing a proper amount of oxygen in the water which would be utilised by certain Marine organisms like the fishes which are present in the water circulation from the ocean would also be one of the function of photosynthesis you have you gone through the new education policy nep yes sir three things which you have liked in the policy and one which you don't like and you think is it is unnecessary new education policy one thing which I liked very much was the importance of vernacular language or the mother tongue so teaching the students of class 5th or 4th in their own mother tongue this is one initiative of the new education policy which I liked other would be the system which is changed from 10 + 225 + 3 + 3 + 4 that system I like because assessment at each level would be good in this way another thing about education policy the dual degree thing I like the dual degree thing because for example if there is a student of science but then he wants to pursue some part time courses in a foreign language may be so he can do that also so I like this one thing which you didn't appreciate you can't think of anything no sir what is your reaction to the foreign universities setting up their campuses in our country is a very good initiative I think there is criteria also that the university should be in top 500 ranking only then it can establish its campuses in India University set up their campuses in India will come in direct competition with our own universities disadvantage of it just one reason Shravan could be that Indian University could not cope up with the competition which is provided by the foreign university but sir I don't think that would be the case because we will always Aspire to be the best and so there would be a healthy competition tell me something about the name for Lord Buddha clan which was present in the Kapilvastu region in Nepal and he got enlightenment when he was a small boy he was known as Siddharth Siddharth and then he came to be known as philosophy which is the most important you are so many things which one is the most important for me one thing has worked and I like that that is the middle path or the Madhya Marg this middle path is different from Lord Mahavir stitching sir it is different extreme form of worship for extreme extremism is not the thing for Buddhism in Mahavir they did they do fasting and all that's not in Buddhism what is the total population of these days total population I cannot be very sure of it but they are mainly concentrated in two three districts in Uttar Pradesh and a few places in Bihar and Madhya Pradesh and answer in Nepal and also the your Sameer North West Delhi do you find any difference between Mainpuri and Northwest Delhi to three differences the most important differences sir in North West Delhi we find very good infrastructure for the education for example the place where I live the GTB Nagar in Mukherjee Nagar area students are there who do coaching and the culture is entirely different from what we see in Mainpuri in Mainpuri it's a bit rural area the city is only female I would like to first of all look into the issue of the teacher absenteeism that is present in Mainpuri I think for that I am thinking about GPS based attendance for the teachers and denser absence of students also because students are not interested in studying because infrastructure infrastructure I would also like to introduce digital infrastructure digital blackboard of electricity over there is not 24 hour electricity like that is there in North West Delhi region from LG TV Khalsa College can you name all the 10 Sikh guru I can try the first one was Guru Nanak Dev and Guru Harikishan was also there Guru Gobind Singh he was the last one and leave it leave it no problem you have also done B.Ed from Chaudhary Charan Singh University News prestigious award which one I am not sure receive the same amount what is the name the last question to you regarding Women's Reservation Bill 2023 it has been passed by the Parliament to be implemented by I don't know why it is not implemented thank you how many districts are there in UP 75 districts and how many districts are named after some Saints number sir I don't know some names Mainpuri is also named after A ratio was Mayank Rishi then not sent but then Ambedkar Nagar Leading lady or very famous women in identifying units would you advocate for naming some district of Assam leading women of UPSC we can name some districts on the name of only need arise to rename a very district which district would like to name after whom Lucknow could be named after the begum who was there what is the name of the Begum sir I cannot recall the name of the Begum but sir since her efforts during the Revolution of 1857 we can name that district on the name of famous recently famous as missile Rani No sir government of India has recently integrated many scientific awards and named it Rashtriya Vigyan Puraskar how many different awards are contained within that umbrella I don't know how many awards are there for different kinds of words Sar I know about his contributions in development of Science and Technology sir about him I know that he was the first Chairman of CSIR Council for Industrial and scientific research sir I am not particularly I don't know about his contribution what are the contributions of JC Bose Jagdish Chandra Bose yes sir infield both in field of Botany also he has some contributions and then in field of science also he discovered the meaning of for example he discovered the millimetre waves much before the European they did and then sir also he invented a cosmograph that was an instrument to study that the plants also have feelings philosophy and philosophy also used to believe that in animate object so have soul or Atma sir is it a Hindu philosophy Indian philosophy identify which exactly sir I don't know the name exactly Jainism used to believe that even rocks have so so prove that even plants have emotions an example of such plants for example we have Mimosa pudica or the Touch Me Not plant social when we touch the leaves because of certain water pressure differences the leaves will built so we can understand that with that plants also react to what we do to them which plants looking at the climatic conditions of the world do you think climate change reality if yes what are the proofs yes sir climate change is a reality proof is provided by the IPCC report that has said that we have already we are not on the track of reducing the climate change as we have the target in Paris agreement to reduce it to 1.5 for 2 degree Celsius and then the other proofs are there like sea level rise so it is a proof then extreme weather events like the el Nino and LA Nina difference along the Western coast of South America but then during the conditions there would be warm ocean current because of which the temperature fluctuations are seen in India also and during the monsoons heavy rainfall is seen in certain regions my last question show you said that Mainpuri is named after some scent and you name them can you identify any of his contributions Mayank about Mayank Rishi sir I don't I am not aware of you only know the name which period He belong to it is story of very ancient times but I think during the time of Vedic time I think very old song famous case in payback in 2015 vs Union of India can you tell me the background of this particular case and what was the ruling in this case I have heard about the name at the moment I can't record so you have you are pursuing your studies of B.Ed from Chaudhary it is very right that Chaudhary Charan Singh Ji has been the Postmaster awarded Bharat Ratna can you please tell me what all entitlements accrued to a person who has been awarded Bharat Ratna sir cash Prize is there how much sir I am not sure but there is no cash prize can you please tell me can you please describe the Memento that is given as as a mark of Bharat Ratna I only know that it's in the shape of a people leave the front side is called upwards and the back side is called rewards can you please tell me what all is inscribed there in the front and the back side and what all is written there can you please tell me what else Public Health system in most of the states I mean Public Health system is in bad shape there is no doubt about this where does the fault line Lie and what should be done to improve upon the situation sir I think the but I have seen according to what I have seen is the bad situation of the Primary Health centres in most of the places even Delhi also what could be the reason the people the in terms of resources we are lacking the people who are many important positions they are not you know indulging into professional discharge of the assigned due to what could be the possible reason and what explains our failure we know about the problems but we are not able to rectify because it's a very very essential and important Service Delivery as such a problem at the administrative level also I think there should be some check on the for example sir in Mohalla clinics real example of Primary Health Care Centre there should be checked on the doctors who are attending the patients and then I would also like to say about the doctor patient ratio in India that is very less so there are very less doctors for the number of patients who are in India so that could be improved can you suggest some remedies to overcome this no problems for the second one which I said the doctor issue we can have more medical colleges like we are planning for a medical college in Rewari AIIMS area so the fund is not released yet we need more medical colleges for the first one answer for the second of the doctor and the check also checks and balances on whether they are attending the patient right tell me teaching Science Commerce Arts it's very necessary that if you want to produce a generation of youth who will be fourth coming to take up social challenges it is necessary that we we need to impart training in moral education where do you see the wastage of moral education in entire scheme of educational things so first thing is that when we study moral science at the school level we have the exams but the marks are not counted so we don't have we don't feel that pressure we don't feel that we have to do this as our academic subject so I think sir moral values should be credited in the Academics of the students so that will lead to the students studying the moral values answer a proper curriculum for example we should include the Bhagavad Gita and the Western philosophers they also proper for the moral system should be there what is do you suggest I mean in order to make the syllabus of moral education more inclusive are you suggesting that you know scriptures or references from Bhagavad Gita should be incorporated in that or we should have a broad based approach while including good things from different religions good things from all the religions for example Bhagavad Gita whatever it teaches then sir even some tribals they have their own religion they have their own information about they have their own moral stories so we should include them also references from Christianity which actually goes well with the system of moral education one line is there for the neighbours love I never as the own that means we should be in sink or we should be behaving well with the word never who has been the most inspiring women of your life my mother wife she has done a lot of things that's why and when I whenever I see her face it's like huge motivation she is the wind below my Wings Shreya yesterday the consumer price index number has been released right it is slightly over 5% what is the importance of this number monetary policy always try to regulate inflation in terms of CPI so it is an indicative of the economic growth and the price rise that is taking place in our economy so this is the importance exactly RBI targets there are three sets of CPI rural CPI combined right and what is the difference between CPI Urban and rural why two different sets of consumer price index rural and urban demand supplies are way different so that's why for example in urban we have logistics also and raw materials is bought from a far of land but in rural places the case is different even the people buying things the expenditure on what they are spending their money that is different as a student of zoology please tell us about this Ethics of food for example in India we have so many ethical standards which is attached with whether we should eat vegetarian food or non vegetarian food so as a student of geology what is your day called as a student of sir we have studied that there is a food chain and humans are on a very upper side of that food chain so we can eat whatever we want like sir we have teeth which are of a omnivore animal we can eat vegetarian and we can eat non vegetarian food also but studies has shown that the vegetarian people they have lived longer some researchers are there on reducing our calorie intake can increase our lifespan so that I think it is moral to eat vegetarian food when we can also save the animals and we can also live longer can you give us some idea about some of the invasive species that we see around us one is camera lens is surroundings very common sir parthenium hysterophorus why these kind of species are challenged to biodiversity or maybe ecological balance whenever these invasive species they invaded area so they just compete for the resources like food water and the soil and they would extinct The Other Natural Habitat other species they would make them to extent India is undergoing a three stage nuclear programme can you tell us what exactly this three stage program is nuclear programme was the brain child of Homi Bhabha so when he realised that India has largest reserves of Thorium compared to the world so he device this program in this at the first stage we would use uranium 238 Al uranium 235 which is the fashionable material in the second stage we will produce plutonium 239 and we will use plutonium 239 it is a breeder reactor that mean the plutonium would be used and plutonium would be produced as well and then in the third stage we would use our Thorium reserves right of having so much of storage of Thorium and a well structured three stage program we are now more focusing on other kind of energy sources like solar wind etc why is it so it's not good to keep all the eggs in one basket especially when we have all these things like India we have a good potential for solar energy and potential for wind energy also we should look into other related to nuclear energy which are related to the nuclear waste that is generated you what is the likelihood of an India China war kind of scenario coming up in next to 3 years your opinion on it is playing a different kind of War there would not be a full fledged War I think they are playing a shadow war create a wire like situation to the level that it do not escalate to a full fledged war and then they would return and geographically also they are located well as when is your interview set 28 March for the interview first means and first interview experience today I think I could express my feelings We have observed that suddenly abruptly and your conversation on any issue suppose the moment you start generating interest in US you just can't start any question what are the issues involved in all that try to be more specific and more points can be given what questions will be asked very difficult for us to tell you what do you see you have studied geology did your graduation post graduation and then B.Ed so these are three areas and you have opted for the also so These areas where some questions will be asked what type of questions will be asked very difficult for us to tell you also but basically you see what is happening in the country particularly in the context of Climate Change and all that and relevance of zoology so like the impact of Climate Change on the animals climate change impacts animals behaviour that is a issue then conservation is a very important issue for the government should balance conservation priorities contrasting things happening one is our developmental priorities that is your ecological balance environment conservation reproduction so what should be our policy to develop sort of a Win-Win situation so those kind of general questions then specific questions you only said about Kerala and all that in the context of human animal conflict so read about the demand of the State Government of Kerala what are the demand for the central government respect to the Wildlife Protection Act what amendments there wanting why they are wanting to declare world war as women that is one of the demands of the state government read about that new education policy we try to cover you have the knowledge and everything is not that lacking knowledge try to slightly more engaging in your conversation then Bharat Ratna you are supposed to forgetting forgetting and he was conferred with this awards are conferred not cash Award that women reservation bill is a very contemporary topic very current topic should be aware of the various implications of the spell conditions delimitation must have heard about that and answers have been added while passing the bill and what is the significance of delimitation and census your studied in Khalsa College which is why question was asked about the Gurus and all that if you remembers good but if you don't remember admit playing that I don't remember it's always better to because these are anticipated questions were asked on the public health issues also which we discussed with you try to update your information rashtriy Vigyan Puraskar try to answer the question to the best of your abilities for something more is there in that if you have time read about that this question may be asked may not be asked about Uttar Pradesh general questions were asked about the women have inspired from Uttar Pradesh and all that on the name of any place based on women's name and all that such questions come as a surprise question you don't expect is not there in your there your
