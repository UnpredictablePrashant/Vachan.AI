do you think that startup ecosystem in our country is really vibrant and growing a what you understand by freebies and everything that government gives for free can you be termed as PB can you identify such reasons in Bihar which are very rich culturally or maybe naturally but the tourist attraction has been developed which major political reforms in India are being talked on nowadays how do you think your education is going to help you in becoming an efficient administrator good afternoon good afternoon please introduction WhatsApp so my name is Ankur And I been born and brought up in Patna and after that said I move to IIT Delhi in 2013 to complete my BTech in engineering physics and then sir one of the college projects with fever doing that we convert it into a startup company sir and last year I joined Indian revenue service customs and indirect taxes and I have taken one year extraordinary leave that what has happened to the start of which started from that startup and other co founders are trying to done that and commercialize the technology which we have developed in which area had started the startup company so we were working on the stubble burning problem we had developed the technology to convert that stable into paper based items like paper plates paper cup Idea was that such small scale 5 tons per day 6 times per day kind of plants shall be installed in a decentralized fashion so that farmers are able to add value to the sources nearby to them has produced as of now we have demonstrated feasibility of the project by installing a pilot unit in the Italy campus itself but the viability part is something which needs to be worked on motion ok tell me what is the thing that startup ecosystem in our country is really vibrant and growing at the moment we have the third largest startup ecosystem across the world and over I think 114 Unicorn companies are there and in terms of regional and technological distribution also like around half of the startup card spread across India not only centred around Delhi Bangalore and Mumbai and thirdly we have women based co founders also in more than 40% of the status in 2023 so around 75% declining funding so at the moment we are saying that the numbers are going with the quality is something which we can work for everyday for startups are restart the natural death what is happening one is funding you said any other issue you can think of cool rational of startup is rather high risk high return and when it comes to high risk then the such kind of eventuality rather higher but apart from funding said there are other issues also like mostly startup focus on the growth aspect of it and the profitability takes a back seat so that in the longer than if they are not able to convert that into a thriving business then at some point of time funding stops coming in and apart from that there are personal issues within the co-founders also the team and the quality of team which is there is not very much in line with what is being trying to projected Angel investors are venture capitalist in our country to support this product is a software based startup and the second that is the hardware based system so it is relatively easy to find Angel investors and venture funding in software startup because the kind of the iteration time is very low one can put in a certain such amount and within 6 months or one year of time one can do multiple iterations of the product but in the hardware based startup where significant cost is involved in assembling the tooling itself and not the product then we need more government grants and other deep Tech funding instead of relying more than any other investors and V6 part of the Government of India revenue service in the government will startups can be used to the government startups are basically in any area to prove that certain technology or certain idea can be converted into a self sus business proposition so even if we talk about let's say the primary sector then at the moment we are seeing that agricultural has a lot of disguised unemployment so using startup to let's reduce the cost part for example coming up with Precision agriculture or let's aggregate model for farm machinery equipments or in fact in the marketing part also like farm to folk model is there some companies are trying to do that so that kind of things can disrupt agriculture at the moment I can think of like firstly for the surveillance part one can use drones to the quality of drones the specific customisation can be done by startup provided to the police services second would be the software part like the facial scanning and the kind of buyers which is there can be customised as per our Indian needs by a startup company thirdly at the moment we are saying that cyber security is one of the biggest concern so there we can develop some kind of Technology which kind of maintains a balance between security as well as digital infrastructure what do you mean by startup bubble it is basically a rhetorical reference to an air bubble which is Hollow from within and burst after certain time so the whole phenomena that startup is the next big thing is can be referred to as a Startup bubble that that is eligibility focusing more on growth and funding as a parameter of success and not the profitability and the impact partner what do you understand by funding winter and which sector in India is currently fa it in this funding winter is basically the session of the amount of funding like last year was around 70% decline in funding mostly in late state startups also so that kind of thing is that ok any particular sector which has been impacted the most any particular Sector I am not ok what do you understand by freebies and everything that government gives for free can you be termed as PB the essential part of Government orders effect like an improving the life please all the life conditions of the people they have a ripple effect in terms of improving the life condition of people but what is the cost at which we are coming up with that that is the point of concern who should be the deciding authority that the government the codes the people who whether it's a freely welfare measures is also a kind of business which is oriented towards public welfare so it is the game of supply and demand and I believe that it is the role of people and the government both together if we talk about international relations and we have had elections in our neighborhood times can you name the countries where elections have taken place and who has come to power recently Bangladesh and I think yesterday your day before election in Taiwan not a essential labour but who has become the prime minister of Bhutan now I am sorry sir I am not remembering the names and what about Bangladesh the Sheikh Hasina has become the prime minister Indian Maldives relations have also hit a rough patch ok in fact the Maldives president has indirectly called India Bully do you think it is right to agree with his views Maldives for India is a very strategically important place and in fact India has also provided Maldives with a lot of support in fact being the first responder in many situations and therefore such kind of remarks at a global level does not reflect the true relationship between both the Nations and in order to address those things those things I think some code group have been formed where such kind of bilateral talks are who is the president of Maldives I am not able to remember the full name but it's music I think now you come from IIT Delhi and which has become the first IIT to open a Overseas campus in Abu Dhabi it is the second IIT Which is the first IIT Madras both were trying to open up the campuses IIT Madras is the first one but where IIT Madras has opened the campus the location to you come from Bihar and in Bihar we have seen a car survey there are views on both sides people support leads to better policy making which is data driven and on the other side people have this apprehension that it may lead to more involvement of cost in politics and right it will have some deleterious consequences what is your view whether it should be conducted at a nationwide level such cases survey which has been done in Bihar in my opinion the rational of the caste certificate evidence based policy making is rather Bonafide and should be something which can be encouraged but the kind of risk which is associated with that say for example being used in Ford as a voting Toolbox politics that is something which can be avoided and I think that if we can rely on the social economic caste census data or other data which are already then that is something which should be encouraged more thank you that your startup is trying to find solutions to struggle burning now this problem has been find the proper resolution as of now you providing one alternative but why is problem becoming so persistent despite having such adverse impacts environmentally in this region there are several reasons of such kind of increase the stubble burning the primary reasons in the short run are basically the legislative there is an act which the Punjab water conservation act which elements that showing season will be extended to let's say one and half months or one month only so those have been the fundamental factors but the essential core region is the over Reliance on paddy and weak base system and that has been because of the guaranteed market availability by the MSP prices provisions double burning and it's almost criminal now to burn and get farmers continue to do it do you think that the administrative system or the authorities and lacks implementation of the provisions in my experience while walking the startup I have two opinions and the first is that whenever we visited those farmers if I may code them they said Ki Dua pahle Hamare ghar mein Jata Hai faded goes to Delhi so there are more than motivated to not want the stock but as far as the blanket Ban is concerned on the stable burning I believe that that can be enforced only if we have sufficient alternatives to update those stock for value addition like we are working on buy with an all biodegradation and a species particular species that is Ganga dolphin has been really popular from Bihar can you tell me its unique features why is it so popular in general that it represents the quality is the proxy for the quality of good water can you tell me other freshwater dolphins in case you know that is dolphin beach river and the I think there is another dolphins in the rivers which passes through Myanmar I am not which are the steps that government has taken for preservation of and conservation of these rules I think the Dolphin Research Centre has been set up and secondly by programs like Namami Gange and other water conservation schemes were trying to improve the quality of water as such as trying to identify the lesser known tourism spots and try to put focus of the public so that they become the new tourist spots in Bihar which are very rich cultural or maybe naturally but the tourist attraction so can you name some of these destinations my native place Vaishali is there so we have a very low number of pages secondly if we talk about then there are I think village tourism is something which can be focused on not specifically any areas but in general as a concept and thirdly if you talk about Eco tourism then came over Hills or rather the national park in the north Valmiki National Park so such kind of forest camping can be improved now if you talk about ft PPT first past the post system is the procedure to elect the parliamentarians and your state Legislative Assembly members can you suggest some alternative mechanism which could be more representative in its letter and spirit for the first person if you have to replace it because it does from certain quarters of academia and other people that it does not represent in the whole spirit of the people in that particular questions so proportional representation would be one which can be considered as an alternative because like in the first past the post system there is a risk that even the minority percentage of converted into electoral seeds which is not there in the proportional system but there is a risk associated with that also like we can there are higher chances that always coalition government and other government will be formed can be a blend something of you know the system could be developed with that of professional representation and ft PT I believe that can be something which can be worked on the basis of our current demographics about you know some political reforms in India which major political reforms in India are being talked on nowadays simultaneous selection is one and reforms in the anti defection law would be another we were talking about you know some the method through which election commission should also be elected so there is a controversy why you know this out of the country has been adopted and what is the take of the Supreme Court on that in our constitution it has been mentioned that the election commissioners and amendment which is proposed by the government that has been like a part of contention on certain quarters so the supreme court that the Prime Minister leader of opposition and the Chief Justice of India shall make a committee for appointing the election commissioners but government came out with the law that instead of the Chief Justice of India that will be a cabinet minister and along with the appointment committee there will be a search committee headed by I think joint secretary level of people those will provide recommendations so I think that is the code of the controversy and Supreme Court has itself said that their role was to act as a transient was to provide a transient mechanism such that Parliament comes out with the law since you must be living in Delhi for a long so daily is also witnessing its own master plan 2041 have you gone through this draught I have not gone through the ground mechanism have been made into this particular draught and its stakeholders have been asked upon to tender their suggestions so to make this particular City safe for the women's participation into the public workforce which kind of the suggestions could have been there because I am not going to the first point which I can think of is to improve the improve the access of police Stations and make it more women friendly installing a police officer with lady police officer which specifically takes care of a woman based requirements second would be there are streets added in newspaper that there are still states and Roadways which are not lighted up in the night so that is something where cctv cameras and other things can be improved upon and thirdly like the public transport system buses or in general I think Metro also special schemes have been provided for women there is accepted thank you have done your graduation in a very specialised subject however when it comes to Bureaucracy we need more of a journalistic mindset how do you think your education is going to help you in becoming an efficient administrator I have done my graduation in engineering physics and that is in fact the best of Engineering and physics so on one hand It provides a specialisation in physics but on the other hand it has also provided the abilities of analytical skills understanding the problems and to be able to have a logical thinking to solve that I believe such kind of learning can be applied in day-to-day administration sir ok tell us what is your opinion on lateral entry into the civil services where we can directly recruit specialist people into the services as we are progressing into the digital age it is very much required that we have a balance of generally used as well as experts and therefore I am of the opinion that lateral entry and other such schemes should be encouraged and even at smaller levels also like a district levels we can have independent consultants from the private bodies but due care should be taken to avoid any kind of conflict of interest can you tell us about some of the physicists from India and their contribution in the Global scientific landscape first would be Dr CV Raman for the Raman effect he got the Nobel Prize next would be not in a sequential order but scientific education system and any woman physicist I am not able to recall the names that India is not able to produce many Nobel laureates the kind of funding we have in research is a very low of the order of 26% of GDP and secondly at the moment we have wide gap between our industries and academia so most of the research work it does not get translated into the kind of impact with it can be made to do some Nobel research we need the interdisciplinary to certain problems which I think something which can be worked answer so do you think are a new education policy is going to help us achieve this goal in near future I believe yourself ok my next question to you what is spiritual tourism if I can think of them it would be for example going to a place for let's say healing and meditation mindfulness such kind of activities would be termed as specific tourism witnessing a proliferation of such Wellness centres which often claim to provide services based on ancient practices do you think this has led to the commercialization of a spiritual practices and the original intent of Wellness is may be lost somewhere I think it is very context specific there are there may be certain companies who are perhaps not following the spirit of such kind of ancient practices but on the other hand using such kind of commercialisation we have been able to get on the first and market The Yoga from India on so I think we can form some kind of a Framework or rules which can get a balance between the kind of marketing and the kind of spirit and just of the Ancient Technologies ok if you talk about India India's foreign policy Outlook has seen a major shift in the last decade can you quote a few instances where this shift is explicitly visible we are doing something now that we are not doing earlier our intention was towards non alignment now our intention is towards multi alignment so instead of being away from the geopolitical scenarios now we are involving on the basis of our own strategic autonomy so beat purchasing oil from Russia or beat openly talking about the cessation of wireless in Russia Ukraine or whether been Isra that would be one and secondly said at the moment we are also projecting ourselves as the voice of the Global south and the the success of the G20 event is an example of that same ok my final question to you honesty is a trade that often puts people into vulnerable situations then what is the point and being honest in many situations or basically we as a human stand for an idea that represents our identity and being honest and being an integral person provides a sense of consistency in our being so that kind of reflects that we are self aware and whatever we are saying whatever we are feeling that has a substance to it so that kind of increases the value of an individual invoice on eyes and in the society Income Tax probability on training about the working of income tax it has been doing quite a lot Good Works for the department has been able to address the issue of corruption till itself firstly I have joined the customs and indirect tax act ok to promote a culture of continuous learning continuous learning can be achieved there is a portal on which one can do courses depending on the attachments which one goes to be able to best suit the requirements there and secondly the idea of mission Karmayogi is to be dispassionate about songs on identity and be passionate about one's own work and that reflects in learning not from the courses but from the people also by stakeholder consultation and by in field training Sector 7 is this is going to help the quality of governance sir firstly it would be a more consultative waste mechanism and secondly the focus should be on role based order instead of a rule based order so it will increase the quality of Public Service Delivery to the last Mile because now it is up to the implemented to implement the rules and laws in Spirit like for example if there is somebody who does not have an Aadhar card but is very evident that he or she needs the food benefits then it is the responsibility or rather the role of that particular government employee to provide with such kind of benefits and it is his training or rather the attitude formation that he has to find a solution to provide such kind of benefit pleasure of rules governing decision making by the government functionaries it becomes very difficult for government servant to strike a balance from switching over from rule based to rule based it would be a kind of attitude changes you also write Hindi poems sometimes sometimes very close to your heart on the contradictions and delivers so it goes like chor hai aap hi ka aapse hi kaisa hota hai kya Jaanta hun Khud Ko Main pahchano Main Kya Jaanta hun Khud Ko Main pahchanta Hun Khud Ko Main Mulakat kya kam hoti hai Jab hoti Kuchh Nahin Hoti Hai Sangharsh Sangharsh hai ya Yahi Dhara do Raste per main khada main abhi mujhe Main Baki hun Sangharsh Hai To Kafi hun ab Dekhenge ya dikhayenge per Palghat to Jaenge thank you Ankush nice interacting with you thanks your second interview how much marks did you get last time 173007 of getting better marks and what you got one last time 1733 waiting 185 also 190 also this time when you go for the interview I personally feel that some questions will be revolving around working of the customer you have taken leave and all that but some questions will be there GST rate reception the act and all that and constitution of GST Council and issues like why should we have only for slaps why can't we have more slabs issues like why important commodities like electricity and petroleum production not be brought under the Ambit of GST what are the pros and cons of that and then the revolution of state GST works or central GST works this amount is divided between the two entities what are the issues involved in that also why some state its states are not happy with this kind of formula some questions my feeling that feeling is that will be on that and then system of taking input credit input credit is a big racket in the department somebody may ask you what is the concept of input credit why we have paid the tax why you want to take back the text you make a saliva only for the finished product while like a building is constructed you purchase cement you pay tax online purchase your MS roads and all that still so and then when the building is constructed then you take input credit for the tax which I have already paid because they are also a lot of issues with that I have you because you are not been working there integrity may not be known to you member of customer landing ground for everybody to lot of questions will be asked on Bihar starting from a liquor prohibition starting to backwardness of Bihar to Why things don't work there and wife private investment is not taking place and governance issues of Bihar and then some reports and all that where does Bihar stand the ladder and why it is happening and if you go to Bihar what are the important Areas where you think you can contribute with your kind of background all that it's society what are needed in agriculture agro based industries animal husbandry Cash crop and all that make a comprehensive note on that needs to be INF Ganga Vilas Cruise their Dolphin is I thought that you would be knowing about the entire gangetic belt between Bhagalpur and Sultanganj which falls in gangetic belt the declared gangetic belt for protection of dolphins read about that is important thing and otherwise you have questions related to Bihar but provision related some questions will generally is asked baby we have to face with this kind of questions in Bihar ban on liquor and this provides liquor are you going to strike a balance between the two when it passes through jurisdiction of Bihar and all that and otherwise you have gone through this process and then startup is of course have some data at you available with you that I will getting on government sites and all that look for that what are the areas have already explained to us Software Hardware and all that any other areas also startups have been trying to come out some success stories some failures and what lessons to be learnt from the success and failures of a standard all that what is the crowd funding what you mean by angel investor and all that and this series at what place at what place of company growth of the company that is wonderful candidate IIT Madras some fact mission current affairs because you are from the IIT some questions on IIT maybe but the suicides in the it is a drop portraits in the it and then do you think it is are overrated in our country and then the foreign universities coming to India setting their campuses what kind of impact is going to back to the IIT why can't we have more of the it is quality and why is the new it is compromise the quality of the general questions are there maintain your personal integrity while answering questions and honesty of purpose that is very important that should never be compromised and balanced videos you are confident you are communication skill is excellent for body language is very positive your engage in animated discussion also that's very good positive points and if good day you make it 1885 90 all the best for side if you have any specific question to ask people to ask any specific issues while communicating my views life and it got confused Saudi Arabia then then the member had to fraud you know this is the first time that kind of thing some confusion in your mind spiritual tourism also spoke about Wellness and all that religious tourism is also has its own importance will come to your mind and then start capabilities capabilities and if it is a good day for you you will get very good
