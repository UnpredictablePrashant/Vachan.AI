can you give me any example of transpiration happening in today's India what if every human on earth speaks the same language any two three major points that you got from that book what are the implication of this for India's economic strategy in the game of chess is Queen's gambit what is Queen's gambit yes coming please give a brief introduction about yourself Uttar Pradesh have done my graduation in BSC physics Honours from Amity University I graduated in the year 2020 and since then I've been preparing if I talk about my hobbies I like to read books and I like to places you are quite passionate about joining the Indian Foreign Service what is the role of Foreign Service office has the primary role of ensuring the diplomatic relations of a country with other Nations they also have certain concealer services providing to those people who are resident in a foreign country and Visa services and other and they also ensure the security and other issues with related to the people living in a particular Nation suppose you get selected foreign service of our country which can be celebrated with the diaspora along with that we can you have certain skills for them for example the migrants that are there in Arab Nation they often face certain discriminatory practices so we can help them in that and also as seen in the case of Qatar that we also offered legal support to the people who suffered sanctions in that reason related to bringing back the people from Israel with the word that is going back again names of Indian sociologist and theory of sanskritisation today still a reality in the Indian society even though by after the caste reservation that has been allowed we see that the low cost are not much employing that but in the rural areas if we see a people do give up for example the given example of transpiration happening in today's India versus for example people give up non veg food in order to be like the upper caste of a reason or we can see the charts which are there in Haryana so that is an example of Sanskrit is applicable to give the concept that sanskritization can be employed to tribals also the reason that there is a degree of integration with different shapes them and since the tables are coming into the mainstream so they do employee certain methods of Yogendra Singh is the concept of you are not available what do you mean by patriarchy according to Sociology Sylvia is that it is a system in which year definition when the male dominates or male try to make definitions on certain accounts on which a female should stand on those parameters so the parameters is said by a male dominated society and the female is supposed to subject herself to that is entirely but they are sitting disadvantages it does act as a root block for what do you mean by feminism it is the concept of allowing female social political economic justice in the social sphere you think in fact not girls but I believe boys should also be famous feminist one last question what do you mean by your what do you call that there is an emotional connect between father and daughter how do you specific word finding that do you have any idea about that what you mean by glass selling it is an effect in the society which is which is said to explain that there is a glass ceiling of Beyond which a female cannot go for a particular social group can not go so that is sociology on the limitation that is to achieve a particular goal is a psychological concept because it is both in cer first psychological because like for example there is a poor girl who is living in a village when she does not have the things with us her or the facilities are not available then that becomes a psychological glass ceiling where is previously we did not allow women to join the forces so that was a social class selling in that manner what is the glass clip how are you doing everyone's of social and economic aspects of equality in the society negative aspect the social systems to work there is a particular stratification that is needed in the society and that goes against the concept of perfect MP3 for example if you want the government to work certain people would be excluded from a particular scheme so to say so that might seem like a contradiction of perfect competition the language diversity because language gives a person identity and as we have language diversity that also allows us to explore certain cultures certain identities everybody has a different identities background in a Time Machine what will be the date in the back you would like to register yourself and go whom will you meet and why and what talks will happen so I would try to go and meet my mother and I would tell her about all the things that I am doing right now how everybody around is and how the society and what all things I have done and how strong I am after so these things I would talk to her Defence Services why did you choose I always wanted to join the Civil Service but I also had it in the back of my mind that I want to serve the nation like my father and since it is an artist journey of civil service and after failing in the initial two attempt I should not compromise on my goal of serving the nation at least so I decided to go for the defence service last year it was also selected as an assistant commandant in CRPF so at least I fulfilled my one dream and then I am fully dedicated to a focusing on my primary vision of being a Civil Servant why not capabilities are better suited for the diplomatic Corps and since I believe I have an interest in international relations also to that thank you what it means that comes from German language and it is not specifically has the meaning but it is related to a Fairy Princess it was also used in one of Shakespeare's play do you think that my family things that and so I do also and you said that you like to read books so what kind of books you read non fiction nonfiction the last book you have read the last book I read was the India way by S Jaishankar so it's a non fiction any two three major points that you got from that I found in the book the first was that the external affairs minister he has focused on the idea that India needs to focus on its national interest in the international relations as we can see in the case of Israel also in the case of Russia also focus on a national interest so that was funny lesson secondly he said that because there is a greater resentment against China so we should capitalise on that because people are looking at an alternative to China for example China plus one is there so India has economic held in that answer third he said that they are going to be contradictions for example we are employed in SEO and we are also in god so they are going to be contradictions but the word would be receptive to it because India is an emerging power and there would be receptive to that Idea so we should also accept the contradictions that are there you have been born in Eastern UP and your graduation is invested in up so what are the major difference in these two parts of up because it being located in the NCR region and proximity to Delhi it has largely an urban based population and both in the economic terms as well as the way the society is there it is open society and we also see a large formal workforce there IT sector is booming in that region from where I come people are still focus agriculture and the per capita income in the region is also not very high and of recent we are seeing reforms but socially also there is a stronghold of tradition in the reason so what are the major problems in Eastern UP specifically from the girls point of view which is holding the social economic development I would say primarily because the society is agricultural based so that also acts as a root block for the women because the inheritance traditionally that is there it does not grant certain rights to the women even though we have laws against that because they are not many employment even use in the region a female often finds herself being held back when it comes to education because family gives privacy to a male child so these are the major reason male child in India sex distorted and economic survey has coined the specific term to this distorted child sex ratio can you tell me that time you result is awaited for CRPF right at the time period with all India rank 26 so what are the various challenges to internal security that India is today traditional as well as non traditional challenges talking about traditional we have insurgency in the Northeast region as also seen in the Manipur crisis recently we also have Jammu Kashmir militancy even though it has reduced but it is there then we also have interest in the country in the form of naxalism that has also reduced but it is challenged still and non traditional for example in cybersecurity we have a challenge also economically it has been seen that predatory practices have been employed in the form of which does a damage to the country for example in electronics we have imports coming from a players which are not favorable to India for example China so that also leads to cyber security conference contribution Regulation Act how is it related to securing relates to how a particular NGO can have foreign contributions in it it has been seen by MSc IT reported that they are around 20 lakh NGOs in the country but their reporting is only 2% so it was seen that those changes were working against the development of the country there were produced that were being and they were also working for players which are not favorable to the country and that is why this law was brought as we know the conflict is going on investigation between Israel and Palestine so what are the implication of this word for India's economy implications the major reason is that from this West Asia we have large number of imports oil imports that come and also gas Input and also because India has around 70% of its trade through the sea region as we can see that because of the attacks that are happening in the Red Sea we are seeing an increase in the insurance for the Ship based achievements secondly we are seeing that the prices are going up also alternative routes around the cape of good hope are being thought of which would lead to an increase in the time what is the shipments would happen so it can have an impact economic solution do you suggest to the international community for the you know I mean so that we can stop this conflict investigation dialogue in diplomacy is the only solution there and has India has said that two state solution to the Israel Palestine conflict is the only way forward thank you have mentioned that you like to play chess so in the game of chess two terms are very popular one is strategy and the another one is tactics what is the difference between these two terms strategy could be like when a person it is a pea plant notion that a person has that they come to the game play with that particular strategy that how they would employ their place when we are playing a game and looking at the counter moves that have been made by the opposition player the changes that have been made could be related to tactics very important and prominent strategy in the game of chess is Queen's gambit what is Queen's gambit is an opening position and it is a relatively strong position in it the porn is moved in such a manner that there is an opening that is there and it gives a strong opening to the person who is your playing so is this opening move available to either of the parties black and white specific to someone I believe it is with black but I have to say do we also have something called as King's gambit is a relatively weaker position because it exposes the king however the highest rated player Madness cars in employees the king's gambit a lot ok you are also student of sociology do you see any relation between family dynamics and investment Behaviour of people in India there is a relation for example if a family dynamics in investment behaviour so there is a relation in the minor that if there is a large family for example if it is a joint family so there is a large pool of resources which would be invested in and there is taking ability would be high because there is a kind of insurance that is there but as we are seeing that join families a declining or the households a declining according to the census so that is Impact the investment capacity education is considered to be like one of the most important component of Human Development but at the same time we also see certain examples where even best of the education fails to install basic societal values in people why do you think this happens it happens because it was also highlighted by the Nobel Prize winner Abhijit Banerjee in yesterday blue that the education that were imparting is more like a jagmag concept in which we teach the concepts and the people learn so that is good in an academic manner but from a value based people do not have those capacities so that is the reason the course of action do you suggest for that I believe as it was also highlighted in the national education policy that we need to import a value based education which means that the Indian relations are filled with examples from take example of Mahabharata filled with examples of compassion for the poor for the animals so I will do stories can be taught to children and practical workshops could be there serving in vriddh aashram is when a person certain rule based order based are not based on any external agency in posting law on them but based on their personal concepts so why moral policing is seen in a bad light don't you think it is a good idea to make people aware of their Immoral conduct morality is relative concept every person has a different morality so in that manner it could be difficult to impose because what might be moral for me but not be moral for someone else for example for me I might think that eating vegetarian food is a moral thing according to whatever moral concepts are derived platform but for someone else that might not be so in that manner it can be can you think of some Universal moral values compassion empathy and final how has the Institution of marriage involved in the Indian society is a marriage is one of the social constructs of the Indian society and marriage has been a historical concept in India even today we see that marriage is seen as a sanction in the as an important concept of the society because the same sex couples were also asking for marriage because it gives the kind of social receptivity to the people do you agree with the Supreme Court judgement on the same sex marriage issue because it did not want to go into the legislative domain but it is say that discrimination should not happen towards the same sex couples so I believe going forward a legislation should be drafted for it ok thank you what is the status of Defence Industrial Corridor in UP what is the difference Industrial Corridor is in progress they are certain nodes that have been made in Kanpur infrastructure how many nodes are there but I have to read on it what is the rational behind the developing the corridor the reason is that previously we have a high import dependence according to Supreme we are the largest importer of Defence products so India wants to develop its manufacturing capacity and for that instead of working in silos we want to have a integrated machinery in which we developed the defence industry and because Uttar Pradesh has a large workforce and also we have HAL and Ordinance factory boards in the region therefore it gives an integrated approach to making difference when is your interview the first attempt first interview questions experienced very good marks in the interview in your Mains examination interview is not going to put you down with this while I asked you to introduce yourself why did you skip your selection in CRPF I forgot it was just in the moment I forgot that design achievement for you select

faced by the contemporary at the cutting edge level what are the ways to Reform Indian police and what the government of the day has particularly with special reference to digital initiatives taken by the state government and the central government both that is one area which we can think of probably your interview take you to another area is your subject only subject I don't think you will have any problem dealing with the issues related to Sociology so Indian sociologist theory International sociologist also like some questions are generally asked in today's context is very important definition of the Indian context correlated with the Indian context and all that that is important few candidates who has opted for IFS as a first choice mostly I find that people have been added have been opting for the year it's a good thing so your passion what do you want to continue that is what is important what is the role in general role you know what and Indian diaspora is becoming a big

infrastructure or financial areas so increase programs have become inclusive program first beneficiary was also from UP only from which place and all that that is another area where the questions may be asked then there from Kanpur initiatives taken by the government and act of the efforts made in Kanpur for cleaning Ganga under project you should have a because magh Mela is happening in Kanpur very so it will be very recent discussion so what all steps are being undertaken by the state government to deal with the magh Mela so to boat services are also getting a must have introduced second

Surprises no conjectures absolutely know doesn't matter if you know go ahead try to give very balance answers don't have to introduce the subject and all that just come to the point so that this girl is able to Grace the problem understand the intent of the question and answers accordingly third take a very neutral view on anything but collegium system be appointment of election commissioner of chief election commissioner don't say that this nothing is right nothing is wrong and you are not a part of the government so whatever information you have you have collected through newspapers and other sources so don't be committed as this I find this is wrong if you are pushed to the wall and if you are asked a question no binary only have to tell me yes or no then only limited knowledge I
