what are the key challenges facing India in achieving 100% rectification tell me something about the contribution of ahoms of the longest standing tradition of Giving more power to women why participation of women in North Eastern politics is less can you please tell me what are the basic criteria for one country to follow in order to be part of NATO who are the hazarika's in context of Assam good afternoon please give a brief introduction about yourself my name is Abhigyan Hazarika in my birth place is there now Golaghat district Assam I did my graduation in Electrical Engineering from NIT Silchar then I worked as an engineer in power grid for around 3 years and the recently I've been appointed as a Assam finance service in the Assam Public Service Commission did you join that some Financial Service recently joined in March 1 March training training so I am on leave currently after interview I will be doing what is the training it is around 5 months training specialist training is there for our career for different classes are held like the accounting rules or Assam Finance Service classes will be conducted by the government departments are following single accounting system that is best accounting system I have not done training so I am not quite the pfc for Grid Corporation engineer and you have opted for a subject like History subject first of all I have a good interest in history although for some reason I did not pass with during my childhood days I was not quite aware of the options that are available so that is the first thing and secondly electrical engineering like although I have been working in the field with regard to the subject and syllabus I had lost a bit of touch life because I have passed out in 2017 and I started preparations in the 2020 so considering all those I thought maybe you would be a better option so I opted for talking electrical engineering you see government is pointing to become 100% electrified country yes sir what are the key challenges facing India in achieving 100% rectification specially regard to the rural areas officially we have been 100% electrified under saubhagya scheme if I am not wrong but the electrification is only as of now with one LED bulb 11 like a mobile charging point has been given so the mean if you are like the distribution lines are not up to the mark in real areas particularly heater is like in Nagaland posted or in particular place of Assam or the interior places secondly in rural areas many places even issues of theft are there so lines that have been constructed have been taken away or other issues are there and the losses are also very high the discount should not be profitable so they have not been able to adequately finance the rural areas love metre in the reconductoring that is required about this Uday scheme yes what is this scheme was launched to to improve the financial condition of the discounts because they have the losses to around 2.5 lakh crores as of now so some amount of loan system from the banks are considered under the scheme but I think so it has not been very successful in this regard to the losses Steel exist to learn of India regarding electrify 1 crore households solar rooftop scheme so our focus is shifted only from the powers and take to the household centric the amount of house and the augmented under a scheme like Surya Ghar Bijli has also been launched so that provided for installation for solar rooftop switcher Steel costly for various people so I think it is a positive step and we will see the progress in future last question from I said you see the topic of tribal participation in the freedom struggle you don't think that this topic has been understood in our country I think that it has been under studied to a large point of time but with the growth of the subaltern school and you are books that have come up we have started highlighting them more and the government also with like Birsa Munda pm janjati Gaurav Divas that has been installed and also the other like who was popularised recently so gradually been taken to incorporate them more but I think still it has been less highlighted as so we need to work on it one of the retired directors has written a book on Birsa Munda are you aware of that which book is that and who is the person who has written the book sir I am not tell me some of the names of important figures and their role in the freedom movement Traveller I can think of you doing of the Santhal rebellion then Alluri sitarama Raju Patel Indirapuram participated in the non cooperation movement was particularly active and passive voice and also various leaders from Assam like money Ahmedabad etc also participated have you heard the name of the book Abhigyan shakuntalam Who is the author Kalidas is the author of the book and he also wrote many other books can you name them I can think of you think about the contribution of homes and dynasty ruled major parts of Assam from around 12:26 82 1826 it was taken over by the British their major contribution was United the various people of various communities caste and tribal areas that are existed in the region and subjugating the other types like 50 years etc also they had a given us a strong example of resistance against the Mughal forces and other forces that have been like the battlefield also culturally it is contributed a large extent to the Assamese society as it is today festival was popularised during the time of the history writing tradition for particularly increased by the and also the new white movement florist during the later ages of the house comprising all consists of a glorious chapter in our history of the North Eastern region as well as India citizenship Amendment Act was that was dated 2019 and the on 11th March it has been notified so what is your reaction to this I think that citizenship Amendment Act is necessary because of the persecution the particular six religious communities net faced in the countries of Bangladesh Pakistan and Afghanistan and it is a special case with regard only to those populations in writing Indian triggered it is correct but as a person or so of Assam opposition always because in some way it is relative of the Assam Accord of 1985 because the cup of date of the people that came during the time was a march 1971 but now it would be send it to 2014 and Manipur is very disturbed Can you provide any solution to Manipur problem anything in your mind what I have observed the money situation is very polarizing in nature the level of Trust between the materials and the cookies of community is very less so I think there needs to be a bottom of approach all the administrators the local leaders and the police and every body should come up to build trust among the various communities and something like a truth and reconciliation committee for resolving the issues can be thought of and initiatives like the ending of the free movement that has been talked about can also I think help in the long run as because a large amount of illegal has been seen in the presence last question from my side India aur Bharat sir I think both are synonymous because as Our article one already proclaims in India that is Bharat is a union of states so I think there is no issue in using either of the two names who is the finance minister of Assam is the only lady to be finance minister in a state of India and do you have any other lady administrator in Assam is the power minister I think those two do you think this is sufficient presentation melody Minister so I think it is comparatively laser and there should be definitely more number of ministers in the cabinet how much they cannot be a particular figure I think sir but the parliament is enacted reservation law for females is less than one third seat in Parliament can be result for women yes why can't we follow the same principle for Council of Ministers I also think like an exact figure something at least around 25 30 I think government will be working on it on the future as because the women's issues are less represented and political environment history what is the special about I am not exactly where but I think then amount of rights given to women with regard to inheritance School it is prevalent I think in regions around West Bengal and also submitting their school is predominantly follow the longest standing tradition of Giving more power to women why participation of women in North Eastern politics is less I think so it has to do with women also not coming out particularly to be involved in political activities in those regions and because of that they have not been empowered although with regards to the patriarchal norms I think it is comparatively lesser in various parts of Northeast for example npc Nagaland or Meghalaya but still and women recently only Nagaland got the first woman MLA if I am not wrong so I think mostly to do awareness and the historical and baggage of not coming out in political sphere is the main reasons and you know that recently the Legislature of Nagaland has passed a resolution against fencing a border with Myanmar yes sir what is their argument why shouldn't be friends the border to free movement resume because the borders the international borders by the British and there is a ethnic continuity with the Nagaland and the naga self administered zone in the Myanmar so they believe that the borders are not accurate and their needs to be some point of time within demand for Nagaland is there that includes parts of Myanmar so due to ethnic community based relationship their opposition is there are two important events which took place in 1839 in India and one important event in the world history what is related to your home state Assam I think so I think that Bengali was declared as the official language of Assam in 1839.9 because 1839 to 1873 it was Bengali in Assam it regards to India not able to recognise final question what do you understand by small savings small like minimum amount of savings which are comparatively less in number that have been stored in like a post offices on micro ATMs etc micro bank is there is some quantitative limit define in the law thank you everyone so we have a special provision with regard to administration of tribal areas for Assam Meghalaya Tripura Mizoram in schedule 5th of Indian constitution know about this 62 6 schedule ok so can you please tell me what were the circumstances which necessitated no inclusion of this special provision of numerous types of their own customs on traditions etc and they felt that if the constitution is completely imposed of them they might lose their cultural basis so initially after independence some tribal Council has been established like the demand of time also due to various issues like insurgency that have kept after 1980 Assam movement so other councils also came up like the Bodoland Council granted in 1993 so basically has to do with their unique ethnic identity cultures customs and traditions so after almost 75 years of your commencement of the Indian Constitution do you think that we need to know revisit the decision or we should continue with what provisions we already made for the betterment of people from tribal areas sufficient time has gone that we need to know come back I think the schedules should be continued in the way that it has been done because gradually with time only the Council has been able to do a good work and to progress like infrastructure attractive come up and still there is a feeling like they have their own very strong fraternal community communal network that they have and so there might be some resentment if it is taken away so with regards to death insurgency the success in countering inside and the comparatively better situation in North East I think it should be continued in the long ok in order to protect the rights of people coming from you know tribal communities we have a we have Apex body called National Commission for Scheduled Tribes a constitutional body and it is said that when this body sets it sits as a Civil Code what is Civil Court in its definition in tail the National Commission for Scheduled tribe is sitting as a Civil Code what is that effective demand it can someone evidence from different parts it can someone people to appear before it can give orders to implement certain provisions to so that its decisions have been following is actually the following it can issue which has the impact of imprisonment of any person cancer decisions we know delivered by this court I am not exactly away but I think with regard to imprisonment such orders cannot be issued any any monetary punishment can be awarded by this body I think so but I am not 100% sure ok so this year in 2024 we are also celebrating 30 years of a very landmark judgement given by Supreme Court of India in 1994 SR Mumbai vs Union of India can you please give some insight into the judgement regard to federalism that was established the basic structure Doctrine after it so it is mainly to do with the procedural Grounds then need to be followed before imposing president rule in a particular state so it was clarified during the time that sufficient time needs to be given to the party to prove its majority like it cannot be removed only for the reason of corruption and sufficient Grounds needed to be exist for that our constitution needs to be submitted for the constitutional orders need not be followed so if we are to impose president's rule and also a Supreme Court had told that it can recall the government that has been given dissolved if it is found that the presidential rule has been imposed with the malafide intention ok last question to you know about Nato yes the membership of NATO has gone to 32 with Sweden joining the military alliance can you please tell me what are the basic criteria for one country to follow in order to be part of network underlying principle of network is collective security so if any country faces attack from any other party outside network then all should come together to fight them then there is a requirement of a minimum amount that needs to be deposited to for requirement to help from all the NATO parties which have been violated to some extent some opposition was their regarding it and if Asian country wishes to be part of NATO Canada Aspire genuinely aspired to be part of NATO Asian countries are there was Seattle was there but I am asking about nature is different not exactly a very if there is some condition regarding who are the hazarika's in context of Assam Hazarika is particularly how military rank that has been awarded to people that 1000 people below them anyone who is above 1000 pipes were also the military and the civilian winning of the home army is known as someone who loves short stories right can you tell us some stories from Northeast India that will be helpful in in helpful in its integration with India some of the stories some of the events may be sir like there have been stories written by particularly being who was the Gyanpeeth winner I like a story within Mrityunjay which talked about the freedom struggle and the Quit India Movement when the train was released in Assam In 1942 so that can be one then other stories highlighting the unique culture of North Eastern India as part of India have been written by Mamuni Roshan Goswami like 17 can be there and also I can think of like Cartoon story which also talks about the beautiful landscape of the Brahmaputra and continuity across Assam and to the first standard you have been an electrical engineer you also worked for power Finance Corporation right tell us some of the necessary safety from the perspective of an electrical engineer that you will take while walking or while leading a team for some important project particularly I have I was posted in a substation in Dimapur Nagaland so we had to be careful regarding it so like we had some and norms language to regularly check whether the step potential and dash potential are within the limits we always used to wear gloves like when we have to manage or do some safety work on electrical equipments then umbrellas were strictly not allowed in substations and nobody was allowed to touch the various so these are some I fine you are working in you are working as a Assam I mean in Assam financial services right there is a persistent problem that for Indian states for most of Indian states that corresponding to their gsdp is quite high right give us certain suggestion how this ratio can be maintained fiscal prudence from the state needs to come up the unnecessary expenses like on like arranging events or like a changing table as a truck can be controlled to a certain extent then we can focus on improving the gsdp of the state for example in Assam the tourism sector has been focused on the semiconductor industry has been coming up which will create employment and automatically balance of the debt to GDP ratio and also the limits 100 that were earlier in post needs to be gradually also a reinforced so that the states are bound to follow the party particular fiscal limits and the strength of the state finance can be maintained right one of the policy of Government of India is the policy of artist through North East right give us certain how Northeast can be important with respect to our artist policy to do it is geographical location as because it is directly connected to south east asia from Myanmar so our importance to notice becomes important and further considering also the growth of notice that is necessary It is seen that rather than travelling through the chicken snake corridor which is very small corridor and the time required is very high so we can think of fruits like kaladan multimodal project for the national waterway 2 that has been energize recently through Dhaka so in that regard it is very important also there are cultural and people to people ties between North Eastern region and Southeast Asia since historical time so all those can be exploited fine thank you thank you very much interview questions experienced is always scope for improvement anything you do even after the best of your performance still there is a scope of for improvement but also done you are an excellent candidate very good candidate you ask you questions on from variety of issues and you explain all the issues the best of your abilities in a most logical manner which is really good you go for the interview basically it's a personality test result examination to call you in person and to analyse various aspects of your personal integrity or not honesty of purpose is there in your answers are not then about your qualities of patient listener or not any other by that mental alertness is there or not understand intent of the question to these are the basic issues and your critical power of Civilization clear logical thinking these are the things and interest your interest and knowledge of current affairs and balance or not available now that you have already had the experience of for long years in the power sector that you prepare power sector a lot of questions will be asked try to cover so you have to cover all the areas starting from the problems to the power sector discounts as mentioned about that starting from your what is the problems in the distribution system what are the problem in the transmission system support problem with the discounts and all that why this problem what is the way out and all that if that is one electrification said that officially it is 100% but it is only an official issues which have also clearly mentioned about sector will lead you to the energy sector that will take you to the renewable sources of energy and all that neutral by 2070 and all that initiatives taken by the government to become a total country and it is a very important for you then the concepts of your electric vehicles that is important because there is anything about the role of Electrical engineers in the developing infrastructure for the electric vehicles and all that the problems with the batteries and all to how the world is grappling with these issues and all that and the Logistic issues in proper rising this scheme and the garments initiative of important things in your concepts like your microgrids carbon trading and all that all carbon trading is done in our country what are the different Agencies over Sing The carbon Credit what are the types of credits issued by different Agencies if we are able to make a comprehensive note that one sector will be taken care of student of coming from Assam Assam Assam is a specific questions may be asked apart from the general studies that is historiography is very much in discussion writing of history do you think that history should be rewritten kind of thing and different schools of historiography and all that you is spoke about the subaltern theory and all the theories and their basically what does the theories in detail and whether it should be evidence based on whether it should be opinion based kind of things and whatever is happening about in the Uttar Pradesh issue and all that is related to history and all that and all that you will understand is state reference to your international affairs chicken neck t-shirt medicine issues our problems with the neighbouring States the problem solution alive to and Assam Accord issues on ucc and all because the chief minister of Assam has been taking a stand and what exactly has exciting the course order what exactly and said what is the intention behind the statement which he had given the must be aware of all that National freedom struggle is very important freedom struggle what questions will be asked very difficult but if you are asked to give a particular name was inspired you in the history you should be able to at least name one and why part of its the rule of women role of tribal women role of women in the making of Indian constitution also general things may be there and then your Kashmiri to article abrogation of 370 historical perspective why article 370 was created in 35a it was created and why it was abrogated prepare all that and you will do well no doubt about it but make sure that you don't ever compromise with your personal ethics your personal honesty if you don't know question don't answer based on services and conjectures ok honesty is the best policy be honest in all your statements ok variety of time that is better glaring in this slightly flash other variants also your I don't know blue will go I don't know I have a blue tigers I don't this time check yourself you should be alright but Maroon should also be good should not give a fresh yellow
