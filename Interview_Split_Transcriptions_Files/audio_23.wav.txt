the teaching line face secondly it is about the job placements in the teaching line for example the placement occurs in the rural areas and people do not prefer such areas thirdly sir it is about the it is sorry it is about it what motivated you to pursue a career in civil services search Civil Services is one of the most prestigious services to serve in the country and one has to be one has the potential to change the society in the right way if civil services is excellent services by State Of Patiala how would you plan to contribute to the development of your district areas which should be focusing in for the development of the district has the issue of economic saturation presently because the service sector manufacturing sector is lacking there so as a district magistrate of Patiala I would be opening the channels for the investment especially in the service sector creating a special economic zone in Patiala would be beneficial their secondly sir it is about the social development Patiala is lacking with respect to the health aspects creation of health infrastructure in district Patiala especially for the women considering the poor aspects of women and related issues moreover education sector of Patiala is not up to the mark the literacy rate is below the national average so working on the education centre incentivising the MSME by providing them financial support the fund creation can be dedicated especially for the MSME sectors liberalization of the policy so that MSME Sector do not face the issue for running their businesses the single window clearance provided for the MSME can be promoted for ease of doing business for msmes questions the animal behaviour so climate change is impacting the animal behaviour by changing the fertility issues in the animals they

is impacted because of the climate change they are again they are not enable they are unable to feed because the Prey on which they feed they are vanishing fourthly the flora is also impacted this has impacted the overall adaptability of the animals in the in their own range what is the primary function of Kidneys in animals cleaning of the blood as well as removal of the waste from our body so it is basically the excretion of the urine from our body Harshita you like painting of Maharaja Ranjit Singh sing a song who painted sir I am not aware about it who painted the painting of Maharaja Ranjit Singh so do you have knowledge about painter Sainik School or in his company with respect to Maharaja Ranjit Singh I am not Have you read history about the emergence of Sikh Empire what is Treaty of Amritsar Treaty of Amritsar was done between the Sikh Empire that is Maharaja Ranjit Singh and the British Empire 1806 was that that's Empire want extend beyond the Sutlej river so it was built by region was only part of the extended waste of list of Satluj the east of Sutlej so it won't enter the mainland of India so that was the major provision of these you know that Maharaja Ranjit Singh was blind with one eye yes sir of zoology have you developed chemistry as to why he was blind with one he had a small pox in childhood and that left blind with one box is basically a virus Fox virus which when impacts the body virus the who declared eradicated who developed vaccine for small box I will read about which substance was used as it was the the basically The crust of the the there was a smallpox that was the crust of that fox was removed by the Edward Jenner and eventually that was weekend and then introduced and because that was weekend and delivered this vaccine for the first time on which person himself looking at little bit economy Economics of health sector how do you read the economy what part of health sector is contributed to our GDP 3% of GDP is basically health economics dedicated towards the health you mean to say that 3% of budget expenditure is allocated for health and our GDP you know is the government is targeting GDP to be increased to 5 trillion dollar so can you tell us $5 trillion means how many Rupees 1 million is equal to 10 lakh 1 billion would be 100000000 question your Harshita means you remain happy perpetually so that means I tend to remain happy but being being in Sorrow is part of life so that means that sorrow does touch me but then I tend to get over it and try to remain happy how do you try to remember I tend to ignore the useless things possible for a person remaining Happy or not remaining happy returns CSIR net jrf also when did you clear it in 2017 so that means it has launched the amount you are not per any research you have been enrolled somewhere no mam I did not Saudi Arab eventually left so it's a kind of wastage of the resource initially itself I did not choose the jrf I gave the exam for my eligibility under net for CSIR and that's why my did not went for the research field it was because part of the examination then I had to appear for that in your answer to sir your mentioning like what are the determinants for teaching profession right why people are not in one of those answers you mentioned that the postings of teachers in rural areas civil service officer you have to be posted in a very remote area you have to be in touch with grassroot realities is it not a deterrent again for this profession people do consider it as a deterrent but mam in my case it won't be a deterrent because I am open to serve anywhere because I have chosen the civil services as my career option considering the overall factors people have that kind of mentality that case and that is one of the factor eventually about ndp 2020 national education policy tell me what are the new things that nep 2020 talks about and how it is trying to change the trajectory of education system in India the overall objective in nep is about creative learning it is a shift from the road learning culture that present education system is in the students that means the earlier policies have largely focused on the road learning methods they were not talking about the creative learnings it was more or less on the paper but if we consider the ground reality it was more about the wrote learning ok so anybody has now explicitly mentioned that we would be focusing on creative learning it would be learning complete example you would like to say that this is the way how they are actually promoting creative learning supplementing the education with the practicals for example if we are studying chemistry were not on the large scale I mean to say that only the teacher would show the practical while the students won't be getting in touch with those real in the real time so now the case is that We the students would be promoted to spectacles in the lamp you want to say kind of hands on experience and secondly mam the change the nep is been talking about is about the Credit System so if we have any kind of curricular activities apart from the Academics talks about you know a transition from stem to steam right in education do you have any idea what is the system and what is this 16 I am aware about stem stem is about the Science Technology Engineering and mathematics what is soft skills and how it is important for a Civil Servant I'm not sure thank you come from Punjab and Punjab is the border state election in so who has become the new Prime Minister and the president has become the new President he comes from which party comes from the Prime Minister and his political party ok no problem so it is said that India Pakistan relations are like a zero Sum game why is it so and you agree with this or you have a different viewpoint that presently the situation and the relations of India and Pakistan are almost on the zero level because the Government of India is clear that when the Pakistan would be promoting the terrorism then India won the open for any kind of diplomatic channels with Pakistan so do you think that talking we can arrive at a solution or not talking is a solution itself so definitely diplomacy is the right kind of solution bringing the parties to the table and having debate and discussion on overall matters would be in benefit for both the Nations ok now India Canada relations they have also been strained in recent times what are the core issues why Indian Canada having this strain in their relationship that has been that has been coming out is because of the khalistani matter that was brought out by the by the India Indian government that because of the liberal policy of Canada the khalistani issues are being promoted in their in their land and Canadian Canadian government is not doing the right that is the issue India has with Canada what about Canada what is should does it have with India so Canada has recently said that India has the role in Assassination of member of one of the Canadian citizen and he was eventually part of the khalistani movement right if you talk about the citizenship Amendment Act 2019 so it has been notified so why this controversy surrounding it lies on the fact that the citizenship would be given on the basis of religious lines and it is a direct violation of the article 14 of our constitution which promotes the right to equality the government is not aware of the Constitution about the constitution but government here is saying that we would be a supporting the vulnerable migrants who persecuted minorities and like which countries and which communities are part of this year 2019 religious minorities of 6 minorities sir Buddhist Christians and which are the three countries and Afghanistan society member write the reason behind the proliferation Harshita the elections are around the corner and the model code of conduct is in place now so who imposes MCC Election Commission of and what is the duration of this code enforcement of this code approximately 45 to 50 days right from the announcement of the poll dates till the commencement of the commencement of the new house or the counting of votes can you also tell us some of the key highlights of MCC for example what kind of activities are prohibited while the model code of conduct is in force the political parties they won't be involved in any religious speeches which would be hurting the sentiments of the people secondly as the ruling party won't be announcing any kind of projects or schemes that would be influencing the people in their own favour deciding factor in elections is the funding the funding which relates to the political parties recently we saw that the electoral bonds scheme was struck down by the Honorable Supreme Court can you suggest some alternatives to this scheme which can ensure a transparent mechanism of funding the political parties my opinion the electoral Bond scheme could be reformed itself because already we had the infrastructure placed for the electoral Bond scheme there was a banking channel but because there were few loops in that scheme that could be removed for example the there was no ceiling hair for the funding for ceiling must be provided apart from that the data was not available on the public domain that must be available time to time for the transparency so such kind of reforms can be brought in the electoral Bond scheme itself secondly serve the complete digitalization of the of the transfers recent prime minister inaugurated a very important tunnel in the North Eastern part of our country can you tell us what is the name of this tunnel and where is it located in the state of Arunachal Pradesh China has launched a protest when are prime minister the state of Arunachal Pradesh so why is China protesting search China under its policy consider that Arunachal Pradesh and parts of Arunachal Pradesh are part of China and they do not consider it as part of India's sovereignty so when the Prime Minister visited they thought that it was interference in the sovereignty of China and that's why they protested what is India's necklace of diamond strategy to counter the string of pearls diplomacy of China necklace of Diamonds policy is been adopted by the Indian government whereby when the China Chinese government has been developing the military bases around the Indian Ocean to encapsulate India India India India India has been doing the similar thing and creating the military in the form of a necklace to counter that string of pulse can you my final question to you can you tell us the names of a few countries with which India is collaborating to counter China with specific regards to the necklace of diamond strategy for example the chabahar port of Iran it is it is to counter the gather port of Pakistan there is a port specialist where the India has created the base ok thank you thank you very much interview is on 3rd April show my third attempt in civil service and first attempt in interview experience but I was unable to answer the initial questions for general in nature is all because of the nervousness that you enter the Chamber as a confident girl as an excited lot of excitement confidence in your body language that itself that is the message from us today because duty

compromise with that what questions will be asked again it's very difficult for us to tell you you are a girl from Punjab Punjab has many issues so read about those issues into Canadian relationship we asked about that migration is another big issue in Punjab then the freebies another your views on the free visa all that is it a political or it is really it helps the target and population to really become financially more inclusive and all that kind of thing you have to have a very clear conflict problem in Punjab so what the government has been doing about it what is your opinion to further improve the situation women's status in Punjab and how Punjabi girls getting married and settling abroad what kind of Trust is a subjected to and all that external affairs has been doing awarded general idea if we are able to maintain a good for you passed out from Delhi University some questions factual questions from the Gargi College of what is Gargi the relevance in our own ancient scriptures and all that that should be known to you ok and do you think that today is women empowerment general questions your subject animal human conflict is very much in news read that area

your carbon circulation questions on Carbon sequestration is having prepared everything be honest to yourself and be honest in your all statements if you have any question to ask question with respect to plan B people say that you must not speak about Plan B because it is considered that you are not committed to your what is your choice as I said yes because I asked this question you said yes I have a plan B so follow up a question was asked if you are determined not to say and you say that I am focused on civil services only and I am pretty sure that the amount of efforts have put into that I am very sure that efforts will be there only what I said that can be always for anybody is always a plan B was a plant explaining the plan B you could qualified for that today that is not relevant as because that period has left right if it doesn't happen though I am pretty confident of getting into the civil services and my drive will come true but if at all worst case scenario I have thought
