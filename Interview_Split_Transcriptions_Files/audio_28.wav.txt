strategic importance of Andaman and Nicobar good afternoon please introduce yourself to the board I am born and brought up in daily I did my bachelors from Maulana Azad Medical College after that I started working at a covid case facility during the second wave of covid and currently sir I am under training for daily Andaman Nicobar island in the services which started on 26th of December 2020 what is your name English for keeping in English of the significance of essential for our body are Heartbeat has the in nature we see day and night have a rhythm season 2 choose a career in civil services during my internship I always try to look patients holistically and not just at the deceased Park so that motivated me to join civil services which will provide me a platform where I can work at preventive level and that multiple domains touching human life answer civil services is a platform where the output will be the input would be much more considering the authority and resources at this process Centre also not tell me looking back what covid has started in all the requirements we have must have the requisite infrastructure and the Manforce the secondly covid is also taught us to focus on the preventive Healthcare resident Healthcare system is one which is able to tolerate any stock how is promoting Healthcare different from preventive healthcare in preventive Healthcare we try to prevent the diseases and in promoting health care services we try to promote a Healthy lifestyle as a doctor do you think that government should and we should integrate traditional medicines with modern medicines have their own benefits they have used acceptance in our society their cost efficient and also are people should be able to get the benefit of all form of Medical Systems available with allopathic system or the traditional medical system for subject like agriculture Medical Science forms the backbone of a society and economy and even sir for health it is essential for the nutritional aspect it is the root of our health care system sir agriculture has potential to solve many of our problems need climate change or to achieve sustainable development goals that's why I choose agriculture what are the problems faced by the farmers in our country about preparing for agriculture and also I feel that agriculture is something which is not only impacting the rural India it is essential for the urban India also and for the entire world food security what are the challenges faced by our farmers example having small the farmers are largely small and marginal farmers the lakh capital the lack of Advanced Technologies why three specific farmers laws government had to withdraw and agitation was confined to only West Uttar Pradesh Punjab and Haryana other states list affected what are the reasons for the development of the farmers agitation law which was farmer produce trade and Commerce promotion and facilitation at it allowed farmers to sell their produce outside the efficiency from the farmers from Punjab Haryana and western up that this might lead to ending the MSP region these are the reasons which are facilitated by the industry that's why we saw protest in These areas restaurant of Agricultural it is this agitation was spared headed by the farmers or a group of people were representing the farmers it was largely the group of people representing the farmers and it was because of their vested interest or keeping in farmers interest I believe was a wasted because the laws were for the benefit of the farmers marketing reforms are much pending in agriculture system so they might have brought into various forms of hard water by central government Rhythm so you have been selected for one Nicobar police service undergoing training right now your father has also been ACP Delhi so you must have benefited from his experiences I will be using tell me history contributions in your life your life or personality has been saved by him working and working even while having food the second sincerity towards work is never late is a very disciplined person and thirdly has taught me to be honest and be a person can you differentiate the police force that is in Andaman Nicobar with that of Delhi wedding day status their condition and also on the basis of modernization sorry sorry this is something I have to get go to I'll read about it ok so in Delhi police they are under Central or State Government Central Government Central Government do you agree with this because the number of persons are said that Police should be under State Government of India and it has the responsibility of providing security of the major presidential state of the major areas like the Parliament and also to the foreign Embassy for this reason for it has been kept under Central Government but don't you think democratically elected state government so keeping police out of that some Siddharth song very good for meaningful otherwise lion order and police comes under state government but in daily considering the reasons I mentioned has been kept under the central government answer daily being the national capital is an area in which the central government and the state government must act as facilitators of each other so they must be no obstruction or conflict among the are working so what about Supreme Court judgement about the sharing of power between Central state in Delhi Supreme Court highlighted that as facilitators and also Supreme Court said that the elected representative forms the government and must perform their functions as per the mandated 69th amendment you have resident and work done that is Zee TV hospital this dilshaad Garden I am also waited that hospital and I am not very happy with the infrastructure they do have what is your opinion so this is a challenge which has been faced by a heritage structure the lack of infrastructure recently there was a case of a death of a Prisoner because of non availability of CT Scan Machine at the hospital challenge and the specially the challenge was that the machine was not working adequate actions must be taken if there are certain instruments are machine which are not working there must be prepared timely sir can you suggest some other measures to improve the health care in Zee TV hospital and we also would have to expand the facilities because it is over burden and indicated to the people of are also catering to the people of nearby area from up so we need more ICU facilities also there when you talk about more manpower is it in the case of nurses or doctors also includes both I am sorry to say that you being MBBS you worked as resident doctor over there and then leaving MBBS for civil services that will be some sort of contradiction civil services I'll be at a position where I can facilitate many more doctors to work effectively for example the issue of lack of infrastructure can be taken at the level of civil services so despite leaving my profession I will be able to facilitate the health care of our country regarding Delhi schools it has been there is a improvement in Government schools in Delhi your mother is also visited over there a number of persons they say that it is just and I was nothing more than that there is such no Reform over there what is your opinion about that so various reforms have been taken taken for daily schools I do believe there is certain amount of change which is coming and which we are witnessing in form of happiness curriculum or in form of Desh Bhakti curriculum but we also at the same time need to increase on ground implementation a more student to teacher connect is required so that we are not leaving any student behind we are improving our overall result but we also need to improve the result of every students last question from my side neem tree so that neem tree plantation drive you are very much fond of neem tree of plantation of neem tree regarding neem tree any State from India having neem tree as a state tree during collect the name of any state and what is the significance of neem plantation significance first we get from the Neem plantation reducing of pollution providing oxygen cleaning of a and secondly it also has cultural significance it is attached with a positive connotation and thirdly also serve the health benefits we get from neem plant is the botanical name of name vector borne diseases Nandini Malaria filariasis Japanese encephalitis Kala Azar and what covid situation suppose in your district there is this went on disease that is spreading very fast and your team has denied that we are not going to corporate because that is gonna affect us not supporting you and there is this disease which is spreading very fast and your district how will you handle the situation what steps will you take understand what are their challenges what are there concerned about their health concern if they are concerned about their health concerns firstly I'll take measures to secure them for example in case of vector borne diseases a covering our body can provide protection secondly I will try to understand the life cycle of the vector which is causing the spread of disease then I will work for eradication of vector because that forms the major control measurement measure from our side second hand in sure intersectoral collaboration between various departments to work on it and thirdly mam I'll try to make it a Jana Andolan for example in case of dengue we educate people do not collect water so all such steps I will take now suppose you have to choose the health infrastructure in the country the public health infrastructure or Private Health infrastructure with the insurance considering India's present situation we do need both form of Public Health infrastructure besides knowing the recent death that you have mentioned in your own Hospital currently we are not covered the entire population under the Private Health Insurance we have the middle missing middle and mam Public Health infrastructure also comes with accountability which is also a concern in Private Health infrastructure and considering the present situation I'll go for public you will go for public health ok are you aware about this cyber security issues which are happening in our country of cyber security challenges are increasing and what steps you will take to make your the cyber attack resilient infrastructure you want to save your data from the cyber attack infrastructure for having antivirus softwares in our computers secondly mam I will work to make the workers in my office aware about various methods or techniques which they can use to prevent any such attack and various actions which they must avoid for example opening and unknown link which can be a threat to our policy in our country right now we have National Cyber security policy explain security attack strengthening our infrastructure and reducing our vulnerabilities Golden hour in this context sorry GPT how does this work is a form of generative to create text or images mainly text or some stories efficient is it working accurately the efficiency would depend on the data which has been fed on it as of now it is working quite well is it legal in India does it has a status I am not very short but it is not illegal it is not a cervical cancer of the cervix as of now we are trying to bring in the vaccine for cervical cancer for 9 to 14 years of experience regarding this has been some announcement in the recent interview so it is universally for 9 to 14 years or it is partial sub I believe it as universal I just want to know your views about medical tourism for India medical tourism as a sector which is gaining popularity in India it is at Sunrise sector and it is increasing with cagr of newly 20% India has immense potential for medical tourism because of presence of skilled workforce secondly the duration for which the patient has to wait for any surgery is very less the cost is also one tenth considered the cost at west these are the factors which promote medical tourism in India and also the policy of heel in India about the policies and the outlook but I want to understand your opinion what do you feel that should be promoting medical tourism because you just said sometime back that for our Public Health Care we are still under serving our citizens so in this context what are your views on promoting medical tourism medical tourism must be promoted because it will not just increase our image across the world it will also promote the economy map it will increase our health care structure overall which will also be able to Cater to a present Indian population how do you see those bottlenecks being solved you are saying that it is not enough for your own citizens and now you want to invite people from other Nations to take advantage of your health care facilities medical tourism is largely provided by the Private Health Care sector of India and when we see the bottles which are faced by the Indian citizen they are largely going to the public health care centre so we need YouTube both the sectors public Healthcare sectors located to the need of a population specially the vulnerable population the poor people or the people from tribal or rural areas that must be enhanced at the same time mam increasing the medical tourism would also help to bring an advanced technology in India mam that and we have seen in case of for example laparoscopic surgery which was something very advanced but now it is easily available for everyone for many citizens for example gallbladder removed by laparoscopic surgery so in that will be able to promote the benefits down happening for the citizenship to describe your childhood how would you describe it my childhood was mostly dedicated towards studies and a very nice childhood with the environment at me atmosphere which was a quiet peaceful and our parents always promoted us to do good in our life and also my childhood entirely or largely dependent on my brother where we spend free time anywhere so one person who impacted the most in your personality in your family that would be who and why my father has impacted me but also my mother is someone who has largely impacted my personality because of the hectic routine of my father and mother was there to take care of us she is someone who says come in every situation and that is something which I will learn what is the strategic importance of Andaman and Nicobar islands are placed in the Indian Ocean they are important to secure the important ceiling of communication and also the location is important for India's India's target of Sagar to provide security and growth for all in the region don't you think that Andaman and Nicobar have not been economically promoted for development of its potential Andaman and Nicobar is an ecologically fragile area and also this presence of large number of tribal population so a balanced approach has been taken taken there but over the time we are promoting the economic development of the region look out countries like Singapore and other developed countries there are also having the same conditions but they are the world renowned cities where is the Andaman and Nicobar is not having that much the reason it is an island Island beauty and being away from the mainland India that might have impacted the growth have you heard this great Nicobar Island project promoting development and promoting the so we need to push for it and so will have to push for it but also will have to take care of the environmental considerations what are the other economic potential Andaman and Nicobar offers other than the tourism and ecology of being a port city for our potential for organic agriculture is having a great potential over there and of course the developing it as a city and infrastructure development aap Delhi is suffering almost full of throughout the country most of the urban areas facing issue of pollution but Delhi's pollution issues something which you will find every time throughout the rain news what are the main issues related to this pollution and the reasons for it is the construction activities which are taking place in the entire daily secondary pollution and thirdly the pollution from the thermal power plants and also there is an issue of stubble burning when we take the ancient approach the stable burning in the nearby States become a concern agricultural optional so from the agriculture that perspective what could be some suggestions to sort out this problem of stubble burning we can use 1832 measures some nc2 measures would be using the stable as mulching which will increase the water attention capacity of soil and prevent soil erosion the survey can use the rotavators and Happy feeders secondly for certain exe to measure the smallest can be used as brackets in thermal power plants and these muscles can also be used for packing Industries do you have any idea about the ongoing Red Sea crisis what is the Genesis of that we have seen attack on various commercial ships by how the revolution Indian porn sex not just Indian porn sex but I am not really sure what is the perspective of India related to the Israel Palestine issue India strongly condensed terrorism but also India focuses on protecting the Human Rights so India has also said that this is not an era of War all the all are concerns must be solved diplomatically but at the same time India strongly contents again my last question to you is you are in police service and being from Delhi Delhi is known for having a specifically the crimes against women so what measures do you think that you can suggest what the government is already doing that is fine but as a police service what measures do you suggest that government need to take so will required to have a multiprogrammed approach in relation to crime against women nearly half of the cases out of domestic violence so that require a Holistic approach where we are able to not Just provide a solution to a woman in form of the legal measures we also need to empower the women socially and economic Research and such cases are complex cases so we do require some long term follow up of such cases we can have women cell in every police station which can take care of such cases secondly we need to strengthen the security outside their home by installing the CCTV camera with already has been done and secondly said by providing Self defence training and forming groups of women most important thing is to have more women in the police workforce to make it more reason that IPC CrPC Evidence Act are getting renamed getting replaced by new set of law what is the revised name of IPC what are the major changes suggested in the IPC tried to Reform IPC from punishment Centre to more women centric we have consolidated the various sections the number of sections have reduced and we have also consolidated and terms like we have a separate section of for women related crimes and organised crimes have been added in the Bhartiya National Congress what is the difference between the two it was any action done against the government now it would be incitement of hatred or discontent against the country capital punishment also provided for some activities are the sections on hit and run in the business structural issue has to be included into improve the infrastructure and secondly provide adequate training to our drivers providing counselling to them we must ensure that while driving they are not intoxicated so this is the major thing which can be done apart from that for implementing the section the talks are still underway take an informed decision whether to implement it as it is or bring in certain changes what do you mean by triple chain of accountability have a heard about triple chain of accountability responsible to legislature legislature responsible to electric final question from your undergoing training as a professional the government is wanting to transit from rule based governance to rule based governance by the Civil servants how is it possible in view of the fact that you have so many rules to follow before taking addition to be able to strike a balance firstly I need to have the educate knowledge and skill of the working of system to be able to make my role based firstly I need to know the rules so based on that I will be able to rationally apply the rules and use the situation and know the situation that the analyse the situation and use my wisdom to act on it ok thank you very much interacting with you introduce you what is was wonderful will remain wonderful you are not going to get less than 168174 1857 ratio I have performed the Mains examination compared to the last year if you have really done well then definitely your rank will improve like anything so with those forwards today is interview with went very well you are very balanced person kept your head on your shoulder not to say so very balanced opinion neutral views and very honest person to be a person of integrity honesty of purpose while answering questions on the requirements of a Civil Servant as a part of a member of the civil services know what all are required for personal integrity is very important honest purpose is equally important you being a patient listener is also very important listen to the questions also in this case intent of question and then give a very balance communication skill and your general awareness on variety of issues these are the parameters based on which your personality will be just and you are bang on this parameter and show it by screen 168 because 168 180 not much of a difference it all depends on your life but you are capable of getting that also that is number one number to know you are not only a medical professional you are also have opted for agriculture and working areas before the board of questions you should expect first is agriculture because agriculture is anything government has been trying with the idea of increasing farming doubling farmers income didn't happen by the targeted dear it has been extended why did not happen and after extension where is where is the revised target and what all policy decisions government has to ensure that farmers income become double in that case various first of all MSP concept of MSP have to very clear about that for MSP is fixed once you have understood that then I'm fall of questions about the schemes like fasal Bima open operation green Sampada and all that 5678 schemes are there if you are not gone through comparisons are also comparison like agricultural system of our country desert area basically how it has not only become self sufficient in food production also started exporting food technology is used technologies are relevant to us we are already agreement with the Government of Israel particularly in the field of agriculture to agro based industries your animal husbandry and allied things and the role of your startups in agriculture field study of all that and what has been the Government of India and all that is shifted green revolution first green revolution happened why the second green revolution is not happening what are the issues you are coming from Delhi issues of Punjab and all that why plan to distribute farmers from growing paddy and all that may lead to the climate change issues and all that is one area where medical field is open area particularly the Healthcare INF actor rural level how you have to improve the content if the country has to progress medically health wise then Healthcare system at the rural area Muslim pro how are you going to strike a balance you have in the city you have a corporate hospitals have government hospital differences between the to the best practices in the corporate hospitals how it can be transferred to the rural areas with constraints and all that some sort of general questions and what the government has been doing about it that is the second area from Delhi concept of Mohalla clinic how far this concept you think is effective just apply generic medicine versus prescription medicine and all that traditional I asked general questions and post pandemic what the government has the Healthcare system as the world most pandemic and then you have vaccine my three vaccine diplomacy all those things are there in the medical field that is second area where you should be preparing 3rd year old bread and butter that is your police service why the perception of people of police is so negative why people don't want to go to police station to fire live what are the problems of police pressing at the cutting edge level then what all Good Works are being done by the police in the field of digital technology that you should be fully available in India is getting connected Andaman and Nicobar Islands its importance International relations in the field of agriculture for our national and the purpose of tourism in all that I think if you cover all these aspects the my impression is 1890 % of questions will definitely be falling in this journey and the way you have answered the question very balance answers you did not take any side you did not take any extreme stunts on anything you are very balanced in the main examination let me assure you again that interview or personality test is not going to let you know best smile more you see smile is one thing which is very natural isn't it if you artificial or mechanical try to smile then probably will create more problems and solving the problem itself isn't it be your natural cell with this kind of smiley have secured 168.8 this is smile can also secure 180 extra smile will not give you any 10 marks thank you sir
