good afternoon thank you how about you I'm good thank you I was sick I was going your profile okay so I feel impressed show me and the team want to understand more about your profile for Christmas 2015 so I currently work at 10 work at an organization called the business research company near my daily tasks involved communicating and interacting with client stakeholders and different managers manager of different team to understand the business requirement related to data I am very much in Microsoft SQL Server where I extract and manipulate data using various SQL functions like joints set operators ranking functions and complex SQL queries I have good knowledge in Microsoft Excel filters data validation conditional formatting I have used a various Excel formulas like we look up all the text function play my functions and also I did some a dashboards and reports using Microsoft Ms Excel I am working knowledge in a database relation tools like a tableau wherein I have created various reports and dashboard and have shared across the teams are the concerns I have good knowledge in Python has been like in the fields of in the like I have good understanding about the library of python like number apart from this I do have some good understanding on the data governance and data Quality Concepts so this was in for me thank you did thank you tell me what is data governance so like a based on a certain criteria like only a few people can view the data so data governance team will be deciding that what is the data quality so it is checking and maintaining the quality of data like we might have some lubricate values to duplicate data duplicate records and like some instances of should be changed and there are many things I just spoke and give an example of two things here why is it important to any business in India or maybe yes sir it is a really important for any organization across across the world because data breaching has become a great concern these days if the customer data are employed data is easily accessible to any other people so there might be many problems so if you have a good data governance for a company so the data will be within the company within the organization and it will not be available to who are like The Outsiders so amazing maintaining privacy of day of customers or clients or even employees very much important these days so I feel that data governance is very much important for any organization yes so that's okay never ever use data management data management in the foundation for any any other business correct know the business is growing their expanding the car manufacturing and business so you are going to hire the first person in data management team search the company that these all things have to be reported in order to have a future reference I mean if we want to grow the business further in the coming days so if you understand the customer service so I'll spin the company that in order to come up with those strategies firstly we need to have a base and this can be done by having the date of the customers so even the feedback system is very much important then only we can improve our product quality and we can come up with different products so I will clearly explain the company that these are the important like I will highlight the importance of data management so and I'll try to look out for people who are having certain skills in the market what do you do exactly in your company yes so basically here like we will be catching the data and we'll maintain the database so whenever the different teams like for the recent project was about financial database management so we had we had to capture the financial parts of a various companies we had a list of around $500 companies so we have to capture all the records of the all the financial data of that companies into a certain database so after that we had some we have different teams here apart from the data analysis we have the reports are teams are greatly we have like the field so they'll be asking for a data they'll be asking us the required data So based on that requirements will be extracting the day and we'll be sending it to the Consulate in customers everything might be going smooth but there will be definitely a case in anyone's life like they'll be certain things are challenges so firstly without panicking I'll try to understand like we are doing the start daily but they said this particular day if I got some issue in this I'll try to understand what what are the things that went wrong so I'll take I'll take like five minutes on it I'll try to understand what is the actual gap between the I mean the actual are and I'll try to rectify myself if I'm still not clear about it I'll try to interact with my team and internet with my manager so finally having a clear understanding on it I'll just check the all this queries or the work which I have that so I'll try to do it like that okay I'm doing a scenario you're working your clients okay that asked for SLA what is it a service level you must have to provide the service is very very important and they are expecting the same time at the same time so I'll try to explain the same that I will put them on the mail to my manager to the director no pleasing way so I'll explain everything at 11:00 p.m. to your manager OK Google so still I feel that like I might be wrong but then the next day morning I might be like pointed out on it but I still feel that client is someone are generating Revenue so the first priority should be given to the client so I'll try to do it quickly and what the task is giving by internal stakeholder directors is going to leave yes so it depends on the like my question I think you were not here if I if I like delay the report and the next working day would be having some okay sounds good so you have looks like a very strong knowledge what is a school Windows function can you explain the beautiful records in a partition or in a table so under Windows functioning we have four different things so one is a room number and second one is Rank and then Frank and the entire number what happens is a unique number will be assigned to each phone inside a partition in the number will be assigned a partition but it keeps the similar values so and in Denver and each it is the same I mean a number will be assigned to each I can give you a good example of Benchmark is like a generally the state government how it gives the ranks to liquor people I mean at the students they followed it and concept and coming to entire based on the input which we give it will divide the it will divide a complete data into sudden partitions for example in entirely if you are giving it has three so if you have 30 report it will equally divided into 1080 equals that is 3 part in each partition it will say no particular number for the reports okay so what is the school set up and what are the prices set operator is basically used to combine two or more select statements and like that there are four different types union union hall intersect and except soil in Union what happens it it will combine both the tables I mean both the select statements and the only combined the it will leave the duplicate things I mean the common things will be removed and in Union Hall it will combine the two sell statement including everything it even includes the duplicate values and intersect only the common things will be joined and in except from the first table only the first table I mean first select statement records will be displayed that to it will explode the common things from the second statement this is how we use that okay that's what is a school joints and what are the school joints yes Joanne is basically used to combine two or more tables in SQL so there are four different types of joints mainly which is nothing but a cell phone and again we have three different categories like left Giant and full joint so basically do you want me to elaborate these things again sorry rules on our data I mean it will restart the different types of constraints are primary key a unique default not and check if if I have to give you an example if I take an example of not know if the end user is entering some null value in that particular column it will just show another it will not take it because we have already defined a kept a rule for that particular problem so concerns are used to restrict the like Direction the customer is using entering some incorrect data how much your comfort zone here I am quite comfortable how how it depends on like a daily basis the major function the major job is like Gathering the day and managing it so based on the change requirement for the stakeholders requirement we do sometimes a daily basis mostly sometimes one or two days we might have another or some other tasks so in a week around 3 days we will be definitely working on writing quotes and Nots how you optimize what is a School images what I understand so that it looks good and it also like when we are sharing the data also when we are sharing the code is necessary so it looks good so firstly I'll try to understand the requirement and after that I have a code for myself I mean I'll write a code very I will understand the requirement I'll check if I'm getting the correct output or not then after that I will try to this would be even more minimize so I'll do that okay great do you have to pay for everything and you want to build a rapport 16 chat box so do you want me to like create a table for us or Joy I just want to get the data from 2: 1 between drop and I want to delete a particular column from a table OK Google and the column name was cities perfect okay what is the fact that everyone can you explain what is practical and dimensions in fact table we have the description family something like that primary key of the dimension table and dimension table we have the description about the fact table so this can be actually classified into three different types so one can just ask him up and second one is too much we will be having we will be having the it is like a primary care of the dimensions for example if a company there's a company called XYZ company so it will be it will be having a fact table and under this fact table there are different Departments of this particular family like HR Finance Marketing sales all these the date of all these particular departments will be becoming the dimension tables what is normalization and denomination is like normally in the data for example a data in a particular column there might be the data should be entered in only two particular things like I'm just giving you an example if it is male and female but if someone has entered instead of mail if someone has ended in there so they don't know it's nothing but keeping a specific like a standard and according to that standard we are cleaning the data that is what I understand from the term normalization yesterday I want to do if you want me to explain on it like will be initially capturing the financial of financials of various companies into Excel so here we are after capturing they'll be like it will be used in Excel and after capturing will be checking for any like when with the cleaning data and cleaning and transforming it so after transforming it I mean after a they will transfer it into SQL and there if we will transforming it I mean by sending it to SPN will try to see if it requires any other further modifications as such and I will be like extracting the data into ESPN and here will be maintaining the databases so already we have certain databases so we'll see we'll check if we in the data has to be entered into that particular database or if we have to create a different database for these set of companies because you're on here will be changing the I am here the date will be recorded right so please check into which state and will be keeping it there and after that after loading it to the final two there so what we do is like a bill will be maintaining it based on the requirement will be sending the data whenever needed and also will be creating certain reports and dashboards even this thing comes when the when the manager of other teams are asking us coming to us there if you want they want to check the company company performance of insert and industry or certain top company performance last year so we will be creating a reports and dashboards using a tablet here sometimes we do it Excel do we do in Excel and sometimes we do it and so it is a combination of both and we create certain reports and we will be sending it to the consent people do you have experience in yes I have like not much answer I use like a number of pandas and my lovely okay what is it what is the difference between I have some understanding but I'm actually working on it so if given some time I'll definitely manageable 84 be like a tablet desktop or Tableau public server and liquor there are two other things but 99% of the work is done in tablet desktop like we will do on the development related things and interior 1% period okay you do customize in a tableau sequel code can you tell me about customer support 8 * 8 I don't have any issue with the word but as you know like to have a financial group like I am I have certain commitments in my personal life so I'm looking for some Financial Group and stability so that is the reason I'm looking for a job change you tell me what is so basically I'm gone so I believe that I have some good knowledge particular areas and I'm also cleaner so if any other tools are required turn on Bluetooth so I believe that I'll be a contributing towards the lake in the voice of the company quickly so I feel that I am a good fit for this particular words what is your restraint sir my friends are like as I told one of the one of the things even under like when the task is deadlines for the task so we will be communicating with the team be working at home around 8 people so we will be coming and will be dividing the work quickly and we will be working on it so I would say that ok Google Shut Up Liquor the discussion was like really good and I like to know like if everything goes fine and like when can I join the company yesterday
