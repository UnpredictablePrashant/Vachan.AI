Alexa good afternoon how are you which part of India okay so what do you know about that you know our company you have any knowledge what do men would experience so we want to know more about your about your educational for the past 6 years I was in the data unless road so like basically at the beginning I was working in my company so it's my first company so I obviously I have like I have no much idea about how data is handling everything so what I did there was like I will be getting better so basically I'm not expecting data from there I used to get the data from the senior people like the singer whoever is doing that we have to first we have to find out what are the disparities what are the address and we have to gather the useful insights from the data site and then we will do the obvious inside and visualization I'll be back later that I already have currently and then we will be using so basically I use Excel and sequel for data analysis purpose and for visualization part I used a tablet so in my previous previous company also so there I have learned python like then I believe visualization for the table and probiotics nice looks like a very strong knowledge in data so what would you were using in your current organization the 2020 get that only a range of things only a particular thing but then I can add a condition there like Select Staff from the table where I can give a condition like employee salary greater than 1,000 or better than 5,000 like that so it's basically giving a condition to fill out our data what is your school concerned what are the different conditions and why you just Google Assistant to make sure that the unnecessary so we are basically trying to get some get some rules and regulations for example Google we are restricting the data not forget about it again yes yes yes yes Google so sometimes we might not be that the information that we need cannot be available in one table so we can connect the table with other tables and we can fetch date data so we have four different types of SQL joins so basically we have in the joint out the joint in the outer John we have three subdivisions like in the router so I left out the joint and the third set is we have Frozen What is the difference between a square and set up router so join basically give the results or some combination of 2 422 select queries you are more select queries what are the different set of operator available in Sequim unions and minus minus what is 2% * 12 and whenever you want to use that we can just simply call the procedure like execute and the procedure name so why using a suppository because obviously it will and it will really use the storage space and it's time it won't take much time you know if you are writing and it will take a lot of time so that I can hear me so you have a knowledge on a Microsoft Excel 1160 with the help of this Excel of the advanced Excel so it's like a it's a it's a common common most important and easy easy easy to use to it but it has some limitations like it cannot store more than 1000 data but other than that it's it's it's very useful what is the size of a data we can store in Microsoft Excel so it's available that column number comma then the sheet in which I want to do the look look up so we can select that entire sheet that will be the second value then the which column I want from the sheet that I'm looking for but she's not calling number comma is it like an exact value or I want the approximate value exactly I can give comma 04466 can you be to explain about production family what is the difference 13 130 I need to gather the information about the students so with the help of python I'm doing it I've done it so I use the I'll be getting something so for me I like to do that without which state or which country should I have more interested in online teaching or to learn coding any particular language recording we have not like that so I used to gather that data recorded according to the city wise or country Wise It's International right so like that then afterwards I used to do visualization I used I used to create boards so that you know we have the higher management teams who are not into technical people because they don't have time to check each and every detail in like the table or it's a bunch of data so to make them understand them into a very simple manner of that that is available at so beautiful yeah okay so what is your strength I would say I love learning new things so that's my strength improve my skills do you deal with the client what is your clients what are the requirements what exactly are the parents looking for so what type of the kids a different from others so for that purpose and then with the help of that we have we have a lot of lot of syllabus changes for the parents requirements and a 5 L of water container and neither one is marked aside from the total volume to measure the exactly 4 L of water we must utilize the container and the table in the right way how is this possible so first I will again take the little container and I will call you I will pull into my phone later container completely and now my phone later again I will fill my play the container pull into my little container so now again what I'll do is I'm going to take my flight container keep it into three so what I'll do is I will be already have a whole letter like to know like what responsibilities are you looking out for me as as your employee if I did also even though we are going for the next further down going for the director labor and client level is that they can they can explore and they can I know and then explain the details of whatever more and more you'll get to know ya make sense
