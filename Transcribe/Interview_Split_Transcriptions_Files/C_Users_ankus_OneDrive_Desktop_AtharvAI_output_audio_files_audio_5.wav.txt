all right so this is a mock interview with Rishi popteenie Rishi has close to 10 years of experience working in the capital markets domain as a programmer analyst and as a business analyst and the purpose of our conversation today is to get to know reshy a little bit better and to understand some of the experiences that he's had as a business analyst so with that said welcome Rishi to the mock interview thank you thank you very much all right so I wish you would like to do is kind of I've had a chance to go through your resume and I see that you do have quite a bit of experience in the domain that is being interviewed for what I like for us to do is to really just kind of get to know each other a little bit and then we'll just dive into the the contents of your real estate a little bit more so I'm wondering if we can start that off with you just play me a little bit about yourself so as you pointed out I have over 9 years of experience as a business analyst most of it has been in the Capital Market space in my most recent project I was working with one of the leading investment banks in Europe and I was part of that I bought implementation I was the lead business analyst for a software that was responsible for the submission of interest rate benchmarks on a daily basis so the bank that I was working for is on the panel that makes regular submissions to Benchmark administrators and that's why this the software is not only critical from a functional or an operational perspective it has reputational risks associated with it as well as absolutely so that seems like that's seems like very it seems like one of those types of projects where there's a lot of pressure to make sure they're not any major mistakes especially with reputational risk we'll get into your experiences as a as a lead business analyst a little bit a little bit later on so that's a that's a great interview that's a great first answer to that question can you kind of just give me a little bit of an overview of the throughout all of the projects that you've been through you know there are certain types of projects where you can be on where things tend to go very smoothly and undoubtedly if you're involved in any kind of IT project you're always going to be involved in a project where things don't go as smoothly for your own experience is have you had any situations where things haven't gone as smoothly and can you talk a little bit about some of the things that you did in that project yes the way I look at it I am only able to make a living because things don't go smoothly because if they did I mostly people like me wouldn't be required I don't mean to be a firefighter but what I'm trying to say is what kind of work that business analysts do is fraught with ambiguity right so and the risk is even more when the when the project deal with a really important things like I bought submission or the implementation of a major regulatory platform like message to sew on a on a regular basis I'm faced with typical issues that business analyst face for example difficult or recalcitrant stakeholders people I would just take holders who are not clear exactly on what they want they know why they're doing something in some cases not even that but mostly I've been lucky enough to work with stakeholders who got the business drivers sorted out but they it becomes very difficult for them to prioritize their needs so that's frequent Challenge and those deck keep moving up and down right so that's something I have to deal with secondly being at the Crux of the development process a software development process I have to deal with development teams with QA professionals deployment professionals devops guys and all of these guys have their own timelines their own agendas and in a lot of cases their own motivations so to balance all of these right that is something that is common that that's something I've experienced in all my projects so I would say that these two are I would say yeah these two other the biggest challenges that in general have faced in my career yeah that's actually great because that answer kind of really your experience really shows through in that answer because what I'm hearing there is that you what's the experiences where you're dealing with a lot of stakeholders who are not totally clear about their own needs first of all you'll have oftentimes stakeholders and organizations where you'll have the stakeholders that you have on your own project or going to have competing needs you'll experience those types of situations on a lot of projects and what I've also noticed in what you're saying here is that you actually have full life cycles implementation experience because if you're working with the devops teams for example that typically means that you are working to move things from one and to another and so you're not just doing the up front business analysis work you're actually working full life cycle lacrosse the entire development life cycle and delivery process which is which is very good just like cycling back to the idea of working with stakeholders who have let's say very unclear needs do you can you talk to us a little bit about you're approaches to dealing with a stakeholder who is when you're dealing with much more seniors stakeholders who are at the Strategic level a lot of times they have a good sense of the direction that they want the organization to go in and they understand their own business needs at a high level can you talk to us a little bit about what you do with stakeholders like that to help them understand what their more detailed requirements might be and to help them kind of clarify their own understanding of what it is that they need operationally what happens with family senior people is that as you said they know of very vaguely what they want but they're not quite sure how to go about and in some cases they might have a set of priorities that's right I used successfully in the past are there is a set of prioritization techniques so there is something called the hundred dollar technique so hypothetically speak to them first list out say the top five or six things that you want to do brainstorm I will not count a question anything that you say let's just write down whatever you whatever comes out of your mouth and then if I give you $100 right now and ask you to spend it on just the top four out of these five or six what would be the amount that you would allocate each of those four and which ones would you leave out that sort of gives me an idea of what what they are subconsciously prioritizing but not able to probably get through immediately that's one second is we use something called Quality Function deployment it's something that is very time-consuming and that's why it's used only when your traditional approach is don't don't have so things like let's do what's benefit analysis so if you do something what is the benefit that you are going to get versus what is the risk of the loss that you face if you don't do it right so a combination of these two things often helps us to prioritize if to take it further what we what I often do is get some technical Personnel involved and add to this makes the level of technical risk involved so feasibility with respect to resources that are available that's also important which helps us sort of get a very good handle on what needs to be tackled first yeah and I think that's a very it's a very effective prioritization technique that you use to basically give somebody a certain amount of credit and say you know what what things do you really want because when you force a person to really have to allocate those Victorian you know credits then you really get force them to kind of think that think through their own what is in a in a very in a very clear way which is which is very good now let's imagine a scenario where we have let's say two director-level stakeholders on your project and you're really spearheading the scoping of the project and you're doing the business requirements and now these two directors have a very different priorities of what they want from you and let's say we have an example where there's one director who is really looking for a certain feature in the product that you're looking to deliver but another one of our directors who is on the same project has a very strong objections to expanding the resources needed to deliver that product to deliver that feature in the product and they are really trying to get their own items on to the list ahead of the priority if you're faced with the situation like that what are some of the things that you can do to help resolve that situation yeah so I faced a similar situation not not exactly the same because frankly I've never had the fortune slash Misfortune of dealing with two directors at the same time but yeah pretty Senior People representing competing into groups so there was just on my last project where are on the eyeball implementation there are two groups that are constantly loggerheads because of the nature of the work that they're supposed to do one is the group that is responsible for getting the submissions out on time the second is our internal surveillance group who will do anything to slow things down so as to minimize the risk of erroneous submissions now you can probably imagine why these two guys are all these two groups are always at Cross purposes right so there was a feature where the submission team had wanted a copy from yesterday feature so figures that was submitted yesterday could be submitted and he was he was really adamant that we should have it but the when this when these features were taken to the surveillance group for the validation they were up in arms they didn't want this they said that if the team is getting paid every day they should be using their brains every day to come up with numbers the software is helping them to do that copy from yesterday is not a good future for several reasons so obviously arbitration is the first approach I tried to get them on the same table and speak about it but when he became clear that there was not going to work and I don't clean the credit for this one of my report is suggested this we support the idea and we put it to both parties the idea was that the submission team would be able to copy from yesterday but they would be able to do that only a certain number of times a week and and the number of times that they will be able to do that during the week would be controlled by the surveillance team depending on the depending on the periods of stress for the bank and so in that experience that you find that both of the parties were I don't want to say happy but where they both willing to go along with with that suggestion yes and they actually want to my support in it and I was really happy that both parties got something out of it not exactly what they wanted but yeah that was one recent example of how we dealt with competing requirements that's excellent and it's good to hear that you have stakeholder groups negotiating in the way that you in that case because oftentimes you'll find that when there are those types of competing priorities a lot of times the two sides can't come together and they can't really agree on a solution that's as Innovative as as the one that your team delivered so that's it's great now let's just imagine the center that same scenario but let's say we didn't have that Innovative Solution on the table and we just really couldn't get the two teams to agree would there be another approach in your mind and handling that situation if that hadn't worked I had only one thing in mind I was going to escalate this to my manager and ask him to arbitrate because he was more likely to be listened to and this might seem like a vanilla solution but to be honest thing that I could have thought of was in in our project right it's all revenue driven so sometimes simple question of who's paying for the future right so if someone is paying for the future and they're ready to have it delivered and it's it's the burden of not executing the future due to sort of an audit Step Falls on the surveillance team then I would tell them look take it up with the other team or your superiors if he produces feature and then later then at least it's not in our bucket yeah yeah that's good and I think that the last option to escalate is always the option that we have to fall back on a lot of times as business analyst when we've tried everything else you've tried all the Innovative approaches that you can take and you're still saying that you're stakeholders are really not able to come to some sort of an agreement then it seems like a lot of times those escalation paths need to exist in the organization and your ability to escalate through your own chain of management as usually the right way to to get those things results that's so that's great I want to touch a little bit on your experience in working with the development and the infrastructure teams in across the different projects that you've been on so software developers tend to have a very unique I would say a disposition and they tend to have their own way of working and in most organizations that's the case but in projects where you're really developing or you're enhancing these Michelle Mission critical systems like the ones that you've had experience working that have massive reputational liabilities possibly attached to them in those types of situations the developers tend to have very very high standards and they have tend to have very high expectations of the analysts that they work with and so can you speak a little bit to your experiences with that yes I would say that I've been lucky we have to work with some really good developers and because they're very good at what they do they expect the same level of competence from everyone around them that is generally been the case but if I had to pick one situation it was my method to implementation right now that was a very high pressure regulatory program that had a hard stop because the regulation went live on the 3rd of January 2018 so there was no sort of negotiation we had to get it done there was a piece on instrument data determination which was really complex and the developers were they they had they had no idea of the complexity but they were they worked very closely with me to to identify what exactly needed to be done it was sort of a symbiotic process because I needed to understand the feasibility of what what I was going to propose so I worked very closely with them and there was a there was a very closed feedback loop all the time so go back to the to the requirement owners take the requirements from them give to the developers check doable check feasible Etc if and and because of this we managed to to implement or deliver a very crucial piece of functionality whereby the developers also found a part of the solution so they were not just writing code but they felt like equally vested stakeholders right from the beginning because their voice was heard very often I've seen projects where even when in some of my ears where I was working with senior beers and they would treat two ways or development professional as separate teams and sort of develop silos in their own heads but I have to avoid that and I've seen that it really helps okay good that's good because those like you said in many organizations some business analysts will oftentimes just treat them as a separate team not really doing a whole lot of consultation as their determining the business needs and writing their functional specifications and they will sometimes only consult the development team right at the back end when they think they have everything ready and not getting that development feedback right up front with a lot of what you're producing can oftentimes create problems for you down the line that you're not going to be able to see so making sure that the development team is looped in all throughout especially for very complex things where a lot of times the development teams themselves will have a lot of questions that the analysts might not necessarily have thought of so having that regular interaction with them and making them feel like they've been heard that they're concerns have been heard is very important for developers especially in this domain so just looking at your resume here so it seems here that you have a bit of a programming background as well so you started off your career initially as a programmer analyst yeah that's right okay and so you would you say that in the domain that you're in that your development background helps you in in some ways or do you think that that's something that's that's just coincidental I would say it's a very important thing it's a it's a great asset two ways so when is first two things I wanted to be in the industry but not in this world I saw that I'm most suited to that so it helped me in my choice of career so that's their of course and having written code for a bit and I still write code in some forms so sequel a bit of python so that helps me understand how they think of problems and solutions so in terms of data structures right in terms of how data would be transmitted stored viewed what could be the Practical difficulties with something that I am proposing so I can't just say you know what is the requirement to go do it it's not my problem so yeah it does help me because I've been on the other side for a bit okay that's great going back to your experiences as a team lead now let's say if we were in the process of launching a new project that we estimated we need five total analysts for and it was in an area that you have strong domain knowledge in in that situation do you think that really not really knowing anything about any of the other endless that are on your team would you see yourself more as a team member initiative like that or would you see yourself as more of a team what is the official position so it could be that the four other the five other analysts are working with me are equally experienced and are equally talented and there is no clear demarcation as to who's going to report to home that's one way of looking at it secondly pieces of work that will be that we are assigned individually obviously at some point we would sit around the table and and share what we're going to do and how to do it share each other's piece of work if it became clear that those pieces are pretty independent and can be analyzed independently completely I insulated from the others then the question of leading as such Doesn't Really arise but if it seems that there's a lot of synergy between the points and bye just consultation really has the knowledge to Fast Track this then I'd be more than happy to follow or lead as the case may be okay okay if I was to rephrase that question let's say in a slightly different way let's let's imagine that we're in the Inception phase of the project where we're still trying to get an idea of what the scope of the project is would you be comfortable in a setting where it is your responsibility to scope out the project and to have another analyst or another two analysts let's say that would be reporting to you where they would be more responsible for doing the details specifications when the time comes so during the Inception phase of the project typically what you're doing is you're just having them kind of tag along with you to listen to the conversations knowing that the ramping up that you're doing of these of these other analysts on your team possibly that you're going to need them to produce a lot of the details specifications with the with the knowledge that they've gained in in doing the Inception with you would you be comfortable in an environment like that are there some things that you can tell us that you think would help you carry out a role like that yes so of course I would be comfortable because I've done that before and what would help me right off the bat is to get the scooping done as quickly as possible because I realize that the school wants decided is never supposed to change but almost always changes so use your contacts diagrams use your feature list and whatever it is that you have to do I would get the scope done first and then it really fast share it with the team with the two people who are going to be speaking it out in in Greater detail and once I know once I get feedback from them how how easy how difficult it is to speak it out to flush the details out to actually get functional testable requirements and then I think I would use that feedback to refine the scope further so sometimes it is this is happened to me before where the scope as is got from a customer sort of start creeping on its own when it's detailed or okay so you'd be happy having two or three or one or two analysts tag along with you in these coping sessions to to help them along and really part of the trouble that you may run into in this situation is that you may have some analysts that who are possibly trying to get into too much detail too quickly play and we would stakeholders you often want to make sure that you're carrying out the right level of conversations with the right people and sometimes you may have to make sure that your analysts that are on your team are not kind of pulling the conversation in the wrong in the wrong direction or two level of detail too quickly as well that's good I think those are all of the questions that that I had with you I want to thank you for attending this interview and is there anything else that you would like to add before we conclude no it was great and I think it's it's fantastic for someone who wants to get into the field and has no idea about what to do so it's great and I appreciate this chance to speak to you so thank you for your time that's good and this was excellent by the way
