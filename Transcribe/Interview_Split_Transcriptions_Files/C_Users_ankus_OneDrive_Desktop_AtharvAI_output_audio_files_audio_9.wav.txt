friends welcome back to our Channel learn with geeks in this video I have invited Hershey srivastava for the power by mock interview he is an aspiring data analyst and is working very hard on his technical skills as well as on his communication skills to get his first job as a fresher in data analytics to me so now let us proceed with the interview part and before that if you're new to the channel then do subscribe it and hit the Bell icon to stay updated all the coming useful videos and you can also follow me on Instagram and friends if you love the content then do hit the like button hello harshit how are you I'm fine thanks for asking can you briefly introduce yourself and afterwards I have given few years for government exam preparation and and after quitting government then I started learning data analytics and and has done few projects in power bi and still my learning process is going on so what is your current technical skills my skills are power bi Sequel and Excel so how many reports you have built in law in power bills so what kind of data source have you used to connect Bluetooth device and loading on a local machine and here there is a limit on data of 1 GB to be published to power bi service and Performance Bike it is better and faster than other connection mode and how's the different from DirecTV internet connection for example and if you have to open the two tables so what is the necessary condition to tables first condition is that both have same column name and the second condition is data type of each column okay and what do you mean by margin functionality in power query when when we have two or more columns and we want to we want to add it to an existing table so in that case we we use much function and we join them on the basis of a common problem and and there are different types of merchants have a column called name called for example your name is written and other names are written like complete name is now as for the requirement we want to take out the first name from that column in a separate column so how will you do that in power query we can use transform we can split the column using the Eugene like space or using Facebook and the opposite if you have to do this for example you have the first name you have the last name of a customer for example and you have to merge or combine those two to generate a caller which contains the first name and last name and how will you do that in that case we can use much column option OK Google how how are Dimension table is different from a fact table you know that all the tables are differentiated on the beaches of Dimension facts right so how Dimension Dimension contains Master data and which does not changes frequently with time and it contains it contains a primary key through which it is connected to the fact table it contains measures and the dimension key through which factor which connected to Dimension Table and there is one to many relationship from Dimension to Fat okay so you said there is a foreign key primary relationship so how do you determine that okay this column will be used as a primary key in this table and this column will be used as a foreign key in the factory so how do you differentiate like how do you determine this column I have to use for creating a relationship so first it can be it can be determined by changing it contains unique values if someone is there and it is containing unique value then it can be used as a primary key okay and how will you check that that column has unique values change by clicking on the column quality there we can check how many numbers of distinct values and unique values are there and OK Google will you do something for this relationship so that get results no I will not support this type of relationship because front of the column through which water tables are connected and afterwards we have to create a relationship between vegetable to the first table through that column and this relationship will be one too many and also we have to join this table through to the other table also through one to many relationships in the starting so what kind of schema you have practiced in now in the morning what kind of building in to multiple tables and other than that everything is image star schema like one Festival is connected to many Dimension table and the fact table is present at the center and the same overall shape looks like of a star okay so what kind of visuals you have used till now in your reports like what are all different kinds of visuals you have used in the report in the reports yes so I have scattered about yes so what do you mean by like what is the standard time and segments of category with respect different from a normal filter that we have in the filter pane of this slicer is different from a filter pin or is it or are they both the same slices and filters know they are not safe by clicking on edit interaction option which which is present in format table so so first of all I will check whether it is on edit induction option is on or off if it if it is off then I will on it and second I will check whether there is a proper relationship between the tables which are loaded in power Bi Rite so according to me when this type of problems support we want to have the total sales of country India for example yes only sales of country India so how will you create a measure for this can you write the message in the chat box yes sir I want to kill you if I'm thinking if on slices three countries and every time when I am which should give the result of total number of cells that have occurred in India forget that you have a slicer on the report just think that we have a card Visual and we have to create a measure which should give the result of total sales of India okay okay okay fine okay I should have to calculate the last month or the previous episode right yes or do you know about the okay do you know about the same period last year function yes so where is it useful it is useful when we want to get some data of previous year for the same period data from the table which is present on the one side so for facing the data we create a major enough table and then using related function the Federal Credit Union access you have total sales and on XXX you have months from January to December but when you have put months on xx's the Sorting order of the months is not in the right because the first will be January but it is starting with March okay some random some random values are there or all the 12 months are there but they're not ordered in the right way we have to order it in the right way from January to December so if this kind of situation is happening how will you resolve it first of all I will go to Table in power query editor and afterwards I will create a calculated I will create a calculator column which will be Monday and it can be done through so much and afterwards what's the message of this new calculator so how did the service not much but only I published mine report to power service so do you know about security yes I know so soft right yes so what's the difference between a pro license and a premium license as a developer as a developer which is kind of license you should have one should have license okay and how Pro license different from a premium license is a premium license a user base license know it is capacity visualizations premium license is preferred by organizations and what kind of do you know about different kind of access levels that we have service for any report do you know about admin access control computer accessories so how are you like Alexa's different from a contributor level access in Beaver beaver level access only time it is for them and user and take an only view the report and they can't do any modifications access taken they can do the modifications if required and also they can grant access to the end user or viewer and what do you mean by dataflows data flows are the Transformations done on the data in power bi service and teach transformed data can be can be loaded and it can be it can be used to report services so whenever so should we talked about roller security a few minutes ago do you know about user principal name that function yes I know so what does it do it displays the text of name of Loudoun County
