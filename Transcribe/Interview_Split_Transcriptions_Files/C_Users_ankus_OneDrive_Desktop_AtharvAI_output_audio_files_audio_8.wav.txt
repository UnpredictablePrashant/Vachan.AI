good afternoon are you thank you for joining in today's interview session how are you doing today morning sir I was doing great thank you for asking so before we proceed can you give a brief introduction about yourself I graduated from economics 2019 okay so since you mentioned that you graduated in the year 2019 and since then what you have been doing so far for a couple of years I pursued civil services I gave a couple of times I cleared them last year so after that I decided to do the certification so there are so many technologies that are available right now in the market right like java.net many others so why have you chosen business intelligence to be your domain why power bi why not any other technology actually when I was doing it I wasn't much fascinated by it because I wanted I really wanted to play with you so I have always been fascinated with data so I like I like to go to the places where I can use the logical reasoning analysis and I can play with the things and I can pick up my stories I can talk to the clients and all so then it is period that I got into this was just just just something that I want you and that's why I decided to give it a shot okay so if I have to ask you to describe three things about power bi what are the three things that you would like to bring to my notice that you have learned from this tool or which has helped you to understand more about data and making sure that you create some awesome visualizations and performing on analysis so first of all the way the very first thing that is good about okay that it actually allows you to gather the data you just set it up from variety of data sources create any server or database or you can even perform a directory without actually getting in the data into the call yet so there are variety of data sources that you can pull into analyze your data the second of all it is also has an idiot where you are transformed the data it gives you very user-friendly interface that you can within a click of a few miles to and the last one I would say it's the power bi service the cloud-based system of the power yet where you can build interactive dashboards very powerful dashboards which you can share with you know multiple developers with your team also they provide you the services for streaming data the real time data they also give you the benefit of the date of course that is the power on the online basically and it is independent of the data set so that helps you differently that's great would you like to talk about the project that you might have worked with power bi yeah so I worked on a mini project with my organization okay so you mentioned that you worked under the Age of Mythology okay so can you describe me how the Sprint planning have been done in your project what was the duration of the Sprint and what all activities that you had done in the entire process can you explain it so first of all I was also have a project manager so he interacted with the client he understood the entire project whatever the business how many developers were involved in this entire project we had six tables so right so when we are working as a team there are give me a times that there are lots of opinions from different people right due to which it might lead to the rise of conflicts when you are working in a team so in case it happens with you in future that you had been working in a team and there are some conflicts of opinions that is coming into picture how you going to react to it or take this and resolve this issue if it happens first of all it is very important to understand the problems from everyone's birthday wishes should not be we should not be focused on our individual cells or individual problem we should always look it from the clients for prospective what they want and what do they expect us to do and we should do it about me that's awesome so if I have to ask you to highlight three strands who are you and you want to bring it to my notice to make this High hiring process easier what what all things you would like to highlight so first of all I like to do things very fascinated by analysis I am very fascinated that's great any weakness that you think that you might have meetings so the business I might have trouble that's great so I think I'm done with the insurance will start with the technical round if you want to have a glass of water in between you can have so if I have to ask you to rate yourself out of five in power bi how much you want to rate yourself so if I have to tell you what are the building blocks of the building alright so what type of databases have you handled using power bi so far left and then I have connected to the Super Service and some databases like so have a good time in the territory so normally how do you create or manage relationships in power bi desktop yeah so after the transformation okay so you mentioned about schema right can you describe what is a schema for in the best of my understanding what I have to schema is basically you know it's a part of a database that holds the table that holds a different tables and it comprises of it in the best of my understanding so can you tell me what is a surrogate celebrate support okay alright alright alright so talking about the dashboard that you might have created in power bi so what all different kinds of charts you have created any custom chat you might have created in any of your projects can you explain what is the Power view yeah how is it different from a power query so can you explain the difference between some function and some function yeah some function is okay so I believe you have used that you also mentioned about that so what are the benefits of using that's very using variables in deaths so variables variables actually cancel cancel can you connect to power bi like ice like I said in the beginning there is nothing to Cloud Post Office and there were ideas so so right now there are two visualizations tools that are there in the market like Tableau and power bi are you aware of table as well so why you think organizations would be using power bi more and not Tableau why you are going for power bi and not for Tableau first of all there's a case of beer and it's not that complicated and second floor you can do all of the normalization stuff all over the standardization so it basically helps us to do everything at one place we don't have to shift to other things again and again for the different ways for the different processes so that I can okay what all different views that power Be at stop container report okay and do you know about remind me to many relationships in power bi and how to handle it so yes so I can explain many to many relationships as such that you know we have different things so we have a primary key and we have so many instances of a primary key is related to the many instances of foreign a different table then that case is called a miniature helps us together okay and are you aware that how the data security what is implemented in power bi yeah so there are a few days with the data security and passwords where we can assign and we can figure out and then we can assign different uses a particularly that this department of a particular organization like financial department of security can you give an example yeah so like I said that Finance the suppose the finance department should only look at the financial field service so we can figure out we can go to the marriage in our home address in the morning so I'm outside I wish can you describe your role as a polar bear developer yes I can describe it by the project that I did in the project we had six of the developers so when the other project manager when I was talking about have you got a chance to work on data transformation what is difference between DirecTV and another important then the I want to be a he has to go all the way to the sequel server and it has to gather the data from the door so it is slightly inefficient slightly slow when you are visualized compared to when your visualizing the data from Time OK Google are different backgrounds so for that I for better representation of my results have you published a report so can you tell me what is Gateway is like a bridge what is the report services list of many different sheets and you can put in a very different visuals and we can analyze the data and that's it and then what is that dashboard dashboard is actually the collection of business services and is it possible to create all this dashboard and report from Power okay then why do we require using alphabetic stuff for using the properties I believe there are many features that you can play your data from the service what is difference between what is different between I have I have tried to use the power apps to my workplace but I wasn't so when I use the app service station do you have any questions to any one of us about so I'd be really glad I'll be ready for you if I could get a better question so that is only concerned and everything absolutely so when you will be working working in a team you will you will definitely come across people who will have similar mindsets like you with whom you your frequency will match so I believe that when you have been matches with someone at that time you jealous with that person you can share things with them and then it becomes a better environment at the workplace so it's the communication that is very important when you talk freely talk and share about your ideas without getting into the politics of the industry then I think life becomes quite easier in the organization itself and I'm very sure that if you are selected you will be working in a very healthy and that that will actually run the weakness that you were thinking that is there a new it is actually not a weakness it is basically the environment that actually affects you when you are in that zone so anyways thank you once again for joining in today's interview we'll meet very soon with the feedback session and will tell you exactly what are the areas of improvements for today's interview have a wonderful day ahead thank you bye
