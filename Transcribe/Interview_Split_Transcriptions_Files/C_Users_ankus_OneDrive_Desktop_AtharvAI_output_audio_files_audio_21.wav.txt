okay so before starting the interview so let me give you a few instructions and then we will start okay so this is going to be a mock interview and it will be recorded and then later it will be posted on YouTube and the second thing is if you know the answer so I can tell answer if you don't know you can ask me to skip the question okay okay so are you with are you fine with that okay so I have two years of experience in automation as a manual and automation testing so let me ask the questions related to manual and automation testing like along with selenium so first let's start with the manual testing okay so before that so can you please introduce yourself I'm handling the manual testing at the automation for the at the moment I'm handling only the automation parts and before working here I was working as a support staff okay and that's all about okay so what is can you explain the process so you are following in your company so just tell me your testing process basically for manual interview play that once all the bugs are fixed will be doing the integration test and the regression test so I have been testing also know I'm not involved in that okay so do you know the what is the basic difference between white box and black box testing is actually we are looking into the cars so what is a static testing and dynamic testing I'm not sure okay no problem so before suppose Avenue like you have some documentation right like you have a function requirement documentation and you have a decent documentation that you will test them so like you will review those documents before actual software is ready so special in the v model right so you will do some kind of testing on the documentation level that is comes under the statistics because you are not testing actual software but you are testing the documentation part which is talking about the software like in the documentation and design part in design how the software will be like design requirements everything will be there in the documentation right so you will go through the documentation you will review the documentation whether they are correct or not completed or not that's something once the software is ready or once the building is ready then you directly test the software so that is comes under the dynamic testing okay yeah no problem so let's say I have an application and you have to test the application but I had to have any requirements so how we can test that we can do at home testing okay so what is the night of testing there is no there is no system you already have some details about what I'm saying is you don't have any details you don't have any requirement you don't have any test cases or any documentation just do you have only application so you want to do some kind of testing on application so you don't have any documentation or anything with you so in that case what kind of testing you will do I'm not sure no problem so basically exploratory so what is basic difference between the exploratory another some requirement even though you even though you have to you don't have a documentation you know some days you have some basic idea about application like you based on your previous experience or based on your previous project you have some experience based on that you will test that application but there you know the functionality list but in exploratory testing you don't have you don't know anything about application at the same time you don't have any documentation with you so in that case you will perform the exploratory testing so that's the basic difference okay okay so when do you perform smoke testing and Sanity testing a complete product okay and what about sanity sanity basically talk about the basic function like whether the software is properly installing or not okay and because if the install is gone if installation is got broken so you cannot do anything else right and all the libraries are present in the installer or not all the dependencies are there in install or not so you will basically test it that's basically comes under the smoke testing so even the developer also can do it developer before providing the bill to the testing team so they can do smoke testing right even testers they can do the smoke testing Because by the time of installation all the libraries are probably installing or not they can test it does go smoke testing and even what is testing sanity testing is done by the testers so once the building is installed whether the basic function is working or not because mean application is home page is playing or not logging is working or not because until he is working can you cannot test the other features or other functionalities right there's a basic functionality testing which comes under the sanity testing so first to smoke testing will be done and then Serenity testing will be done so smoke testing can be done by developers as well as testers for a sanity testing will be done by the testers okay that's the difference okay so do you know what is the difference between build and release building what is the release what is the release of something that we gave them yeah so basically the building play the uncompleted software which is not completed yet right is in this still in the development stage or testing stage and some piece of software which we can say is a piece of software and still it is under the development and testing but the entire software is developed and tested then we will finally released to the production right or release to the customer so that is basically called as a release right and that will be the quality product finally okay so you mentioned in your profile like you are familiar with the cross browser and transformed testing so what is the basic difference between these two crossbows and cross platform testing we are using Chrome browser Firefox platform that is cross-platform okay so can you just come again what is the basic difference between cross browser and cross platform is mainly multiple browsers multiple browsers and cross platform is the operating system will be different okay and what else only operating system and is there anything else different Hardware configurations so all these things comes under the cross platform OK Google supposed to listen you have some requirement right so you have to start writing the test cases so for writing the test cases what you will refer what is the input for that and while writing the test cases will you follow any techniques there is no problem do you know any testing techniques even though if you're not using project but generally do you know any tests I'm not talking about software development process models and talking about software testing techniques the weather in the test cases so have you followed any testing techniques while riding the test cases know okay do you know like what is the equivalence class partitioning boundary value analysis or decision table have you heard about these things so they are actually techniques party while preparing the test cases and tested okay so do you know about agile process how they will different from other places models I just know the basic functionality of another functions okay so what is an what is an additional thing you can see in agile how it is different than other places like that is it's a two-way Sprint okay two weeks pregnant so all the program programming and the testing goes side by side okay there is no complete stop to the I mean the production bill so when they there is about it's done and that is side by side tester OK Google lower the computer built right or complete software so even frequently after every Sprint we will be able to deliver the software to the customer and finally he can use the software and again you come back you come back and tell what are the latest changes are required so that we can accommodate in the software so that is the main specialty of the Hazel process right okay so in agile do you know about what is product backlog and Sprint back lock screen all the tasks to the specific number of people and there will be here so if there is something that is that has not been done in a Sprint that is called a Sprint completed no actually this is not not about any task is a difference what is the task task is something which is requirements requirements in a job we basically called as a pic and stories right so product backlog basically contains the all the stories which are collected by the product manager so whatever the customer is a toll writes all the requirement will be put inside that product backlog so those requirements are basically we can call them as a stories so they are called they're all available in the product so that's called Product backlog basically product owner or product manager will prepare the product backlog so from the product backlog we will choose some of the stories or epics and we will plan for specific painters specific printer right so they are basically Sprint background so that means whatever number of stories for that particular so which we can call the message Sprint backlog okay there's a basic difference between product backlog and spring backlog okay and what is the duration of Sprint cycle normal duration is 2 weeks or two weeks okay so 223 weeks okay depends on the project and number of stories and what is Scrum meeting and what do you do in the scrap meeting and how it is how it will happen in the Jail daily tasks up okay yeah so it is going to be 15 minutes turn on yesterday and what are the new blockers are there or what is the plan today and all these things will be discussed in the during school meeting and it will be around 15-20 minutes and daily stand we can also call it as a daily status and do you know any ceremonies in agile process what are the what are the ceremonies will be done in the agile process like a Sprint review meeting in respect to meeting have you ever actually OK Google have some basic skills and automation I can see in Java and selenium in your profile so let me ask some questions from java first and then we move on to the selenium okay all right so in Java so what is the basic difference between a Constructor and a method how do you know what is Constructor in Java or Construction in one single class yes okay so then what is the difference what is the purpose of Construction Construction plus if you want to send some data to those variables normally we can create a Constructor so whenever you create a object of that class The Constructor will automatically inbox okay the time of object creation itself will pass the data to the Constructor and Constructor will initiate the data into the variables and that will be automatically invoked by the object itself at the time of object creation and why we create a method in the class the method is normally having some logic so which may take parameters or may not take a parameters or may return value or may not return on your requirement you will Design the methods in the class so if you want to invoke the methods through the object so as soon as you created an object has through the object you can explain better so that's a basic difference between Constructor and methods all right so no problem so do you know about overloading Concept in Java what is overloading multiple arguments are passed through the same method okay okay so multiple arguments in the sense what is the basic concept of overloading can you elaborate okay no problem so basically we can create multiple methods with the same name in the class because when you create a class we can have multiple methods with the same name but when you have the same name again the message we will change the arguments or we can say parameters so we can specify the different parameters can be different as a one method is taking to parameters that will take three parameters or if it is taking to parameters again that I can be different so in that way we can create multiple methods within the same class that is the basic concept of overloading so while how we can call those overloaded methods when they call that method depends on the parameters suppose play calling the matter when you pass to parameters so whichever method is be created with the two parameters will be invoked similarly when you call a method with three parameters so the meter which we created with the three parameters in the class will be so depends on the number of parameters it will decide which method we need to call to object right so there's a basically called as a method overloading like we can create multiple methods with the same name the same time we need to follow the number of arguments should be different if the number of arguments should be same then data type of parameter should be different there is a concept of and what is overriding what is overriding no problem let me just leave that concept and okay let me move on to the automation so for example you have 100 cases and how we can choose the test cases for automation how we will know what is it to be automated how to test cases should not automobile automation systems so whenever you start automating test cases we need to give the high priority to those test cases and trusts same number of cases will execute again and again multiple times so we need to put lot of time and effort there so if you automate those test cases a lot of time will be reduced if it will be reduced so play the first part is always go to data-driven test cases like a data is required some test cases available to use data will be there and then regression test cases we will choose for automation testing okay all right so in Automation in selenium especially have you know about are you know about locators Concept in selenium you know about anything else so what are the different locations are supported by selenium so do you know what is an expertise Shimla to HTML tag okay so how how expensive will identify the element how expert is how what base is expert work actually how expert will work on work while identify the element or do you know anything about Dom document object model so basically Xbox one so normally if you just look at the page HTML page or whatever like period so whenever you Xbox Xbox on the dump structure it will navigate through each and every note to find the element again we have different type of expert but normally expert will navigate to each and every note and then find the element okay all right so what is the difference between find element and find elements so there are two methods that are available so find element will find the element that is the first one only one element of the same Xbox all the elements that is with the same expert will be returned okay okay so for example let's say I have find element method in that I provided one locator and that located is matching more than two elements play more than one element and which element will be returned by the find element the first element okay so same thing for let's say find elements in the find elements also I created one locator and that locator is matching with multiple elements then how many elements the five elements method will return all the elements right so for example yeah so in the for example in the find element the locator is not matching with any of the element there is no element with that locator for example and then what will happen in case of find elements time out of 30 seconds or something like that the code find elements in the find elements also I provided a locator and there are no elements or matching in the web page and then how the find elements method work so the locator is not matching with any of the elements so whether it will throw exception or not if there are no such elements in case of find elements are you sure okay so no problems are not available find elements with their return 0. 0 development find element method will return the web development whereas find elements method will return the collection type set collection of list collection list of element so if there are no elements or matching find elements method will not throw any exception it will just return the zero elements okay that's a difference okay so what is the difference between clothes and Bitcoins clothes and Twitter so what is the difference between clothes and twitter.com 10 browsers are open I want to close based on my choice as I want to close second browser or fifth one or eight one so how we can do that how we can close it so based on my bass on choice just I want to close specific browser instead of closing specific one so I want to close multiple browser windows but based on my choice will it take any parameters they won't take any parameters okay and I'm not okay okay no problem okay so they don't take any parameters basically so okay so do you know about like window get window handle get window handles do you know about these two method get me to handle and get me to handles yeah I just know about that okay so what is the use of handles so this is related to my previous question so if you have it and I want to close specific ones based on my choice so then we need to get the browser window ideas so first we need to capture them and remind me to write a loop statement like we can repeat each and every ID browser window ID we need to switch to each and every browser window and whichever browser window occurs based on the idea that will be closed so it depends on our choice we can close but here we need to write a logic by using get me to handle and get window handles okay yeah so what is the use of for actions class have used actions class action clubs so basically actions class provided different methods so by which we can perform the mouse operations like mouse mouse what is the what is the method we can use to perform right click action contacts to click.com okay so what is the difference between actions and action do you know about action no problems by which we can perform the most operations right so there is something called action interface so we can store the action so action interface can store the action that means suppose when you do some hours of operation let's say action class object dot so context click off some element dot Bill Dot perform you will write the statement right so when you say Builder's action will be completed but when you say only right so that will return it so that action object will be stored in the action type of variable and then we can complete the action by by using performance so that's a basic reaction is a class action is an interface which can store in action and perform is a method by which we can complete that actually so there are two things here creation of action and Performing that actually play creating the action then perform will complete the direction so that is a basic difference okay so how to handle the job dot so I want to select option or value from the drop down so how we can do it any idea so do you know anything about Alexa suppose if you don't have a select class we have other approaches to handle the Dropbox okay just go through them and which is very important also in automation okay so how do I change the parallel testing suppose I have a test case I want execute on multiple browsers at the same time so how we can do how we can do it we can use a test engine do you know about sessions in Destiny assertion what is an assertion so if you want to compare something like if you want to make text message start a session we cannot say there's a test case when you automatically there should be some validation point right in Destiny how we can apply the Variations by using assertions so very important okay you have to learn that okay or do you know about data provider interesting like suppose you want executive with the difference of data and that will be provided by another method so that method is basically we can Define that is a we are having a we can use methods and classes and there will be object repositories so there will be we can reuse the court and better understanding of the models okay so what is the use of page object model what is the benefit of you will get from the main benefit is that we can use the code in multiple places and a person can easily understand where the methods are called the names will be used to that okay okay yeah whatever you said this correctly and basically application right so you have so many test cases are there it is one page on your web page application there is one page and let us say which country is a 10 elements and you have about 10 to 20 test cases are there which are referring the same page okay the same page elements are you using in 10 different test cases so what do you need to do normally if I don't use page object class or page object model you have to identify those elements in every test case right in every test case you need to identify the elements and then you have to perform the actions from the elements so let us know if you have a 10 elements let's see how a 10 test cases in every test case you need to identify the elements I need to perform the actions in every test case and what is the problem in this the first problem is you are repeating the same and duplication is there and suppose tomorrow let's say some attributes are properties got changed for those elements you want to change the location to go to each and every test case and then you need to modify those elements attributes the locators you need to modify right because your same elements you multiple test cases so that is a problem so to overcome this particular problem we go with the page object models in the page objective please send every page we will create a separate passage object class so there we will maintain all the locators and action methods so the same page object class will refer in multiple test cases so in that way we can avoid the duplication and tomorrow if there is any update in the attributes we can directly go and modify the page object class so that will automatically invited all other test cases okay so I got it so that's the main advantage of page object class okay so this is all about selenium so I'm done my side okay you answered well so special for manual testing and but you need to prepare more on Java specialist because I have asked questions I'm not asking any practical oriented questions so I'm just asking questions very basic okay but whatever you know you answered well but you need to prepare more on Java specialist okay because you have two years of experience in automation but this time you should know more okay okay I will expect more play Ashanti's experience but you need to prepare well okay possible I'll take another walk into you if possible OK Google that's all thanks thanks for attending the interview so thank you bye-bye
