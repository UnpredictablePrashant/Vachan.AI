I'm very excited to be doing this candidate Showcase with Simon wild today and this is because Simon is a very experienced professional with more than 20 years of experience in the IT industry working mostly as a business analyst a business analyst leader and everything in between Simon has extensive experience working in the public sector working in the financial services industry and in utilities so let's welcome Simon Simon welcome to the candidate showcase interview I'm wondering if we can just get started off with you telling us a little bit about yourself hi good morning now thanks thanks for doing this in Canada and the UK for 1:20 a.m. to retail stock brokers in the UK and moved from there to Professional Services freelance for a few years and move to Canada and I've been working essentially in the financial services from predominantly the fun space for the last 10 years all right excellent excellent now looking at your profile here I can see that you have an extensive amount of experience in industry and that's a professional who has that kind of experience you're inevitably going to be running into a lot of different ways of delivering software and so agile as we know is one way of delivering software waterfall is another one I'm wondering if you can speak to us a little bit about your experiences in trying to implement agile in the organizations that you've worked in sure so implementing agile I think it's really dependent on the The Experience the team that you're working with one organization I worked in agile was kind of seen as a euphemism for being a cowboy and so try to steer away from using certain terminology to try and focus more on the benefits and efficiencies and getting value out and helping people understand that so a lot of it in terms of implementing agile has been about the communication part making sure people are aware of the benefits I think that's true about implementing anything even if it's a new piece of software so different approach really trying to make sure that people are aware of with trying to keep the communication lines open making sure everyone's involved everyone's aware and what's the benefit of getting a minimal value proposition out as soon as possible what's the minimum viable product you know how can we get something out to you as value as soon as possible so that you're going to see the benefits of this straight away and then you can build on that and really kind of installing the benefits of doing that kind of minimum implementation and then building on it now I mentioned combating the The View that it's being agile can be seen as being a bit of a cowboy Behavior what I mean by that is it can have a perception that you're trying to do something just quick without any care just get something out there as quick as possible my personal View and experience is that you can put as much rigor into agile as you can in any other methodology and it's really just down to how you structure and work out what the bounds are and what the actual needs of the organization are for example if there's documentation means meets agile doesn't mean you don't document anything play common misconception I'm glad to hear you say that yes yes in a different way that's right or use a different structure for example traditional business requirement documents may have long paragraphs of text one of the things that I like to do is to break that down into finite points using a user story structure do you really make it finally something that you know is easy to understand for both the stakeholders the developers something that's quantifiable for the q18 is well and it also lends itself to to uploading into things like jira team Foundation server so you have that traceability of things as well yeah and I'm so glad to hear you say so many things that you've said because much of the perception about going agile I think in the industry maybe a little bit off of what practitioners see on the ground and how many liters many it leaders even in Industry tend to have a very overly optimistic perception of what agile can do for them or they tend to have the idea that agile is going to get them to do a lot more work in a shorter period of time I like the fact that you emphasize on the fact that the idea here is for us to get a minimum viable product out as soon as possible which is really the main purpose of going agile and I think it's to your experience is in Industry to know the fact that in many organizations agile can sometimes just be code for doing a chaotic way of doing an implementation very unorganized and so a lot of people will put the agile label on that and it's good to see that you have the awareness as an IT practitioner and as a leader you have the awareness that these are some of the major pitfalls of going agile so that's that's very great to see I see also here on your profile that you have experienced establishing a ba Center of Excellence which I think is a very large and beneficial thing that can help organizations in a big way I'm wondering if you can speak to us about some of your experiences is in taking that on sure I mean essentially I would say that one of the reasons that drove me to to do that was that the organization was working in it at the time when I joined had no understanding of what a business analysis team can do and so part of it was about building awareness of what is professionals are able to do and offer you know how can we get that to the team right and getting it out in a way that people could access it and see what was going on so part of it was about increasing the visibility of the team part of it was about increasing the capability of the team part of it was about putting in processes and procedures and I want to say putting in processes and procedures it's not a case of here's a template you must fill out section A B and C in this way it's more a case of here's a suite of tools that we have in our toolkit that could be used in different circumstances is it appropriate to use this type of uml diagram for example is it more appropriate to do a slide deck who's the audience and putting in place things like regular weekly sessions for continuous development together we would get around a table we would discuss a point or they'll be a particular learning so getting a number of different things in place to help really strengthen the capability of the team and make sure that we're constantly building that so one example would be putting together a business requirements document as I've mentioned before I like to use user stories within them say hey look here's an example could this be applied to your projects and the other part of it as well that I have mentioned is ongoing coaching so once one sessions with individual basis if they needed specific help on a specific project or a specific tool really try and help homeless skills and make sure they have a stronger set of tools in their toolkit yeah and what I really like about your approach to establishing this Center of Excellence is the fact that you're not really just applying a templated version of processes and procedures what you really encouraging your team your business analysis team to do it seems like as part of this initiative is to understand that they have a set of tools available to them but not all tools are appropriate for types of challenges and as part of being an analyst especially when you start to get into the intermediate and senior level is really having a clear understanding of what tools are appropriate for what situation so I really like the fact that you take that approach where you're making a tool set available to them and really leaving it up to the analysts and guiding them through trying to determine what tools are the right fit for what situation so that's a that's a very important point there can you maybe give us a little bit more insights around the challenges that come with having to Mentor more junior members of a team or having team members who you know a lot of times when you have different people on your team you have analysts that will have be at different levels of seniority they will be at different capability levels can you maybe just talk to us a little bit about some of the challenges of doing that type of mentorship with your team members sure I mean I would say that mentoring my Approach is more around coaching and one of the first things that can be challenges if you're working with someone as a coach they need to be coachable they need to be open to the coaching so a big challenge can be not trying to coach someone that's not willing to be coached so really understanding your team and I guess it's like with any project even you need to understand the stakeholders you need to understand the people you're dealing with understanding the communication needs really think about their needs and adapting what I do and how I approach them to their specific needs yeah and that's I think that individual style of you know trying to figure out what is a person's personality what is the working style and and working around that I think is is your approach to managing and growing and play a team of business analysts so let's switch gears a little bit and talk about some of the more practical aspects of actually delivering Solutions so product management is a role it's an up-and-coming role that has gained a lot of popularity in the last couple of years I'm wondering if you can speak to us about some of your experiences managing different products inside of organizations financial institutions or any of the other experiences that you've had sure I would say a majority of the the products work that I've done has been on regulatory products so products that sit within a regulatory framework so for example products which have taxable benefits but in order to do that so most of my experiences and then and as well as defining all of the the rules for that up front making sure that they were delivered we made sure we had the MVP of the minimum viable product launched in line for when the legislation kicked in so we're actually able to facilitate one of our clients opening the very first one of these but then looking at the backlog of other requirements so building that list and maintaining it prioritizing it so that we can get those subsequent releases out to the clients so that they have a more robust a more flexible product and then building that on keeping in constant communication with them to understand the priorities you know the other delivery Cycles we had as a software house what we had to do in terms of other regulatory deliverables what resources available against what the clients wanted so that we can get an effective release out to them so continually developing those products in a way that the client is going to see additional value coming to them regularly right right and building so the type of product you just described is a product where you basically have a set of clients that are external to your own organization that are going to be using that end product that you're building for them and as a product owner or a product manager many times that is one scenario that you can be up against but another major scenario that oftentimes gets overlooked when we discussing product management and product ownership is the organization's own internal product needs so for example you'll have an organization that needs to launch a new HR System this HR System is exclusively for their own turn on use can you talk to us maybe a little bit about the differences in the role of the product manager for external products versus internal products and some of the challenges that each of them might have I mean I would actually say that there's a lot of similarities between the two and I wouldn't tend to draw a distinction for me it's the focus on what's the priority what's the available resource what's possible for us to deliver how can we get that value out what what's really important are the regulatory milestones we have to hit is there a market opportunity we have to to hit and one organization we would regularly have a fun team identify opportunities go to launch a new fund and then we would have to adapt priorities not just for that particular product but other products that were in process live as well so that we can manage the resource can I use the product backlog managed the backlog for each of the individual products as well alright alright so it can be I think a little more complicated when you've got multiple products versus a single product but I would say that the difference between internal and external and not huge still looking at how to get the value out what's the most important priority given the resources what can we effectively deliver and I think part of the important thing that you touch on there is the fact that as a product manager you're not necessarily focusing even though you might be managing one product yourself and your organization might have multiple products there should be some recognition of the fact that your products oftentimes are not living in isolation so many times if you have some sort of a feature that needs to get released to the client in one product that can be oftentimes either constraints that you have to live by because there are other products that your product is living with or there can be some other capabilities in other products that you might be able to leverage so I think it's important as a leader what your demonstrating for us here is the fact that you understand that product management can be much more complex than oftentimes many people can think about it when they're just thinking about trying to get one single product out without really paying attention to the entire portfolio of products that in organization can have so that's a that's a very important point there now just for scenario base thinking for for ourselves I'm wondering if we can really just kind of thought talk through about how we would tackle a certain initiative so let's imagine that are senior leadership strategic at the Strategic level of organization has decided that they are going to enter a new market what the new line of business or a new product let's say we are a mutual fund company or some similar company to that and we want to get a new product a new business product out let's say a new type of fund out and we've recognized that we may need to do some extensive work inside of our organizations to build the capability to roll this new product out and to support it ongoing can you talk to me as a more senior leader about some of the things that we have to do in order to be able to roll out this larger type of initiative sure I would say that first of all the the very first thing you I will always suggest everyone does is work at exactly who the stakeholders are that needs to be involved you know what are the different teams in for a small isolated product you can do that fairly isolated within an agile team and a limited number of people who won as a larger initiative in a larger products perhaps in the processes then we need to involve more than just a small team so we need to understand who from the different teams around the organization need to be involved for example do we need the operations team do we need the accounting team do we need the sales team and who is the most appropriate person within those teams that need to be involved particularly in those discussions up front but absolutely on an ongoing basis and from a product management perspective they're going to be the the people that I'm going to be talking with the about you know what's the highest priority how do we look at the backlog what's the most important things what are the things that we need to make sure you'll be delivered and bring the compliance team in to make sure that we're hitting the regulations correctly and then look at what the needs are for each of those teams what the impact is of this new product does it mean we need to change the processes does it mean we need to change the software does it mean we need to change the manual processing and how do those pieces fit together and what's the evolution of that you know how do we look at do we need to split this into multiple phases how do we do that phase delivery and at which point do we need to bring the training in which point do we need to bring in other experts or subject matter experts in you know which point are we going to be ready to actually start working on the development of this and what's the target date for so a lot of different factors but really always focusing on what's the highest priority what's the minimum thing that we can deliver to get the value out there for this product and how do we manage the impacts of that together put in the plan together looking at the dates what's realistic what the impacts are of if we need to bring more functionality in do we need to slip the dates can we slip the dates and what are the impacts yeah and that's excellent I think that you really are focused on making sure that the internal resources are coordinated and mobilized is a very important part of making sure that that this type of a large initiative doesn't face any major obstacles because often times in organizations that try to do very large scale transformation or roll out changes of this manner oftentimes you'll find that you have the buy-in of many people in your organization but you might not necessarily have the buy-in of everybody in the organization so you mentioned compliance for example who in many organizations and many financial institutions the compliance organizations allowed at a time is stretched very thinly because of the fact that the financial industry is so well regulated that compliance really needs to be on the ball in their kind of need to be ever present in most parts of the organization and often times in those types of projects it can be very difficult to secure the time and the resources that you need to be able to to have them engaged in your project to make sure that you're okay from a compliance perspective so if you are ever in a situation where you're seeing for example that a very key stakeholder who you need for the project is really not interested in taking part are there some things that you can do to try to get those folks more engaged I think it comes back to earlier about really understanding the stakeholders and their individual needs and that sing the way that I'm interacting with them to get their buying you know how do I make that connection how do I build that trust how do I get them to understand the benefits of what yeah yes people are busy and but it's working with them to try and understand how can we actually do this together right this isn't something for me this I'm here to facilitate for you how can I make your world a better place and if let's say that is I think normally for most practitioners you always want to make sure that you're taking a software approach showing people the benefits of doing things the right way but often times if you're dealing with a group who really just doesn't have the buy-in or they don't have the resources you can still run into a dead end so do we have any tools in our tool belt is there any other approaches that we can use as a method of Last Resort if we're still not getting the resources that we want I think it's the same with any conflict and often you know I would like in Conflict to the example where maybe you have a sales team that wants to deliver something which is at odds with the regulations in the compliance team to bring those heads together and facilitating that conversation and again I think it comes back to that discussion around product management and prioritization you know as a product manager you're going to want to bring those stakeholders together and discuss the restrictions that each of those team members have you know how do we manage that what's the real priority for the organization facilitate that discussion you know I've shared change approvals where we have to really negotiate between the teams and the heads and the sea level stuff there you know what's the most important thing for the organization do we have to to take a hit in some areas in order to be able to get this greater good right and so really it seems to me like you're approach to this would be in making sure that there is a broad involvement especially on a large scale initiative like this that has maybe the buying of the CEO of the board and of all the other senior leadership to that it seems like would be to make sure that this is Bradley communicated and the leadership of the organization has the obligation really to prioritize their resources in one initiative versus another one so I think that that's typically the approach in many organizations where when you have senior leadership oftentimes you need to get access to either the senior vice president or the CEO themselves to to make sure that they are really very clear about their about their own priorities so I think that's a that's a an approach that works very well in many organizations and so in terms of the questions that I wanted to go through I think I've learned everything about your background and your profile and have a good sense for what you're capable of doing is there anything else that you would like for us to discuss well I'd like to say thank you because I think this is a great initiative and it's a great way of sharing experiences part of what's important for me is continually learning absolutely different things to pick up and I think this is a great way of making knowledge more available to the wider audience yeah absolutely absolutely and I want to thank you because I think that the perspective that many of our junior or aspiring professionals are lacking are the perspective of senior leaders who have really been on the ground in the at the implementation level so appreciate you spending the time with us to impart some of your knowledge in helping the more junior members of our community really understand how things are viewed by by the leadership of of organizations absolutely I mean I think this doesn't matter how well you're doing something there's always a better way yeah yeah and to our audience members I will be leaving contact information for Simon so please feel free to reach out to Simon and connect with them for for anything that you want and I want to thank you again Simon for appearing on the show and imparting your very valuable knowledge and will be in touch thanks and have a great day take care
