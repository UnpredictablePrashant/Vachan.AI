can you please tell me a little bit about yourself so my name is Harsh so I started my career as a production support executive for a couple of years and around 2 years there I work with Oracle and unique selling Etc and I was providing a support to the application called HP service manager then I shifted my text text to at night and then I shifted my career to cloud and I also got an opportunity to work on one side location where I started my cloud journey and in Cloud I have experience to gcp and at 0. 0 0 6 I have a team of 10 members and Technologies I'm working on ADF databricks by spark and little bit of python okay so total is around 8 to 10 years of experience here right yeah yeah 9 years okay great so shall we start with the idea of part first yeah sure okay so can you tell me how you will move the data from on Pandora in case of on Prem to Cloud migration we need to create the integration runtime manually by using a cell phone status integration run time so we need to we can download that that is kind of software we can download from is your website and we can install that into on Chromecast is not good enough and why we need cell phones to indication time is actually like it automatically decide like where the target is hosted right so because that are disconnected settings it cannot buy pass the firewall so we need to manually install the software into on sale service how cell phone you can bypass the firewall and why Auto result cannot bypass what I mean what extra you will do what is the difference there so in case of self-hosted we are manually installing the software right and after installing the software we are installing the same integration run time in Cloud side as well and there we are generating a key and that key we are mapping to on on Prince Right while installing the software on the cloud print services that that key is belongs to the cloud site that integration Center gets connected to the cloud on Samsung Cloud get connected by using that we can simply create a pipeline like we do for sale like your company and on the right hand side you have an on-prem of let's say Oracle and that is for the company too okay now I want to transfer the data from one to on Primm two using ADF how we can do that you got the question we can create a common staging location in the cloud service we can host a weekend first to connect our first company on trim service directions I want you to run a pipeline on every last working day okay of the month now how you will design that pipeline how are you so we can use it the last last day of the month let's take an easy last day of the month I think there is an option to we can take Mark to use that I like run at the last working day last day of the month that we can do that's fine that's fine now let's take it to the next level last working day not the last day now last vacation Monday to Friday and if there is a holiday at the Friday it should be like Thursday and if it is Thursday it's a holiday it should be like ovens to calendar of each month manually because it cannot be decided by the system because it depends like someone some holiday might come and like we can manually create a file and we can take a look up on that file then using the tumbling window trigger that last working day it will take from the file and as soon as that matches with that filed it will trigger to some condition we need to write yeah exactly in schedule so it's possible but I'm not sure very very much because if we want to do some customer service put some particular interval then we use the schedule window treatment and if we need to do some customization or some like you said like we need to like we need to like you skip the runs propose and and if you need to like using the same trigger if you need to run multiple of pipelines or some kind of customization if it is required then we use that I'm not getting the exact scenario in my mind something which is not a state for what they need Tumblr okay no problem okay let's talk about the few things on to the Parkside as well you can write barcode and high school sometime soon now this file is a CSV file okay now while you reading the CSV file the CSV file is we called it is not like every room is not just a number one line so I will get ended up in a multiple lines so let's say of one row of a table is like comprises of let's say five lines second row is also comprised of three lines like that so in the CSV file your one row is represented not by just one line but it's like a multi-line so every day is a multi-line rose how you doing such kind of whether it is possible at all or not possible if possible then it's a CSV file yes CSV file I think it is possible so we need to give an idea is equal to spark Dot read.csv and there is an option we need to give like multi-line is equal to 2 I think so that we can use a problem are you sure I'm not sure but I think so some options do you heard about the complex Jason value inside file if it is there then it is known as complex station make sense now imagine that you have to read a complex Json file in the spot how do you do that dot okay no worries date so let's keep this song now till this point here itself so let's get into the second part of this entire mock session that is like a feedback part so first of all I feel that you didn't exceedingly good job a few things which we can you know change a bit but whatever the monks I have taken it I think you are quite well prepared okay so let's first thing my first suggestion you know a lot of things and you need to be confident of yourself okay I can see that out of let's say I ask around 8 questions and out of that almost seven questions you have answered almost right almost right so you know a lot of things you need to be a little sound little bit more you know confident maybe it's a mock interview that's why you could be not that confident or I mean it's not that way but yeah you can be confident coming to the first question when we talked about the integration on time you were right that the cloud we need a selfish immigration on time then we talked about it why why we need it then you said it correctly that there's a firewall problem and that is there so there is a small one thing that you need to understand when I say that that how the cell phone indication on time will allow me to make a connection and why Auto Reserve will not allowed to make a connection you said it like you giving the keys here and there so that is just like the registering the cell phones to indication that is nothing to do with the connection okay so you install one machine you install the cell phone on that machine and you make a cell phone screen indication on time into your area of account and that you just registered each other there isn't the reason why is indication and time is Maya connection because the machine on which your cell phone is installed have an access to your so maybe this is coming into the same network or at least if it is not in the same network this is specific machine IP addresses fixed so this fixed IP address might have been white label or you know why did it into the fireball of that server so then if any connection coming from that machine probably will be allowed and that is why generally this is a selfish allowed to make the connection so this clarification needed okay then coming to the next stop when I when I asked like on premium you said it like put the staging layer in between there is almost right because technically understand technically it is not possible that two different system two different companies two different on-prem can be run by the same mostly it is not possible okay so because it's between whenever you're doing between the two private it's not possible the way is like you put it in the staging and then you do it because like both of them have a different because when copy activity uses it uses only one self-hosted higher so probably you need one cell phone you need one from two so that that is a problem so easy solution could be like you can put it in between the staging put that the staging data I mean staging area and then copy that so you are almost right on that there as well but be confident that's the point so that cloud to Cloud right then we talked about the last day on the last day of the month you were right there is always options you can pick that option I think that option comes for that option is going to come for the your schedule even trigger as well now the problem comes in when we say that last two working day you said it like tumbling window needed tumbling window is not necessary its tumbling window does not have any condition like that so the condition that you need to put is at your like you may be using the effectivity so if activity would be doing that conditioning so maybe you have one you said it right that you have a look up maybe in the table or in the file which is have a holiday list you pick the dates from there and you check it like okay if today's date is not I mean let's say I'm running it I would just take like tomorrow day is a working day or not if tomorrow is a working day probably and it's not the last day of the month you know it makes sense like that so you have to use some kind of an if if you follow whatever it is whatever comes along but family is not the right solution okay and then we talked about difference between the tumbling window and the schedule triggers completely wrong okay there was play don't answer so can you schedule triggers can associate with multiple pipelines but tumbling window associated with the only one pipeline but you said I mean other way around okay tell me when you can set the retries you can set the concurrency you can set the dependency with the other tumbling window all these options are there which is not there in the schedule event tickets OK Google that there is an option of multi-line and that will solve your problem of getting the multi-line CSE compilation I think if I'm not wrong at this point you don't need to have anything for the competition you just read a simple like the way you are getting it will read only the difference is when you try to access it so when you try to exit you have to you know you like dot operators so the first Jason you will see the data frame column name is a data frame dot call 111 and if that column name has another decency is a colony of that so you just only difference comes is when you access that value otherwise I think complex Jason also read in the exactly the same manner there is no other country music great so I think you did good I feel that is quite strong a little bit here and there if you try spark also looks good even though you're not spent too much time because you are a little bit on the time but I think you're doing well and you know a couple of things you have to just be confident when you answer it so be confident because when you answer it it feels like you little bit trying not very sounds confident so whatever you say be confident okay yeah that's that's it thank you so much okay great
