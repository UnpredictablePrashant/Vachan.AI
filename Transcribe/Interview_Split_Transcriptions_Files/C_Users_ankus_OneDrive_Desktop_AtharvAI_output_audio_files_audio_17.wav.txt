YouTube YouTube do you have 40 years of experience in front and write 2.5 more than I thought I heard 4 years into three parts first part will be something question mark duct tape to tell the browser that which version of HTML we are using yeah that's correct and what is the use of ha what is the use of head of time headache attacks which are basically the title of the documents it can also include the external links like hours so I have one question for you what is the weather today #or in the body tag just before the closing body time the better place would be just before the body closing closing body time because we don't know what is written inside that script if it is like accessing the Dom elements and if we put it just before the body tag like in the head back won't be available there so it better to put just before so if I asked you to not put in the body type put it in the head like that and I like the code is accessing down elements okay yeah we can do that with the attribute to hold the Javascript file and execute after the Dome has been completed passing yeah so you're saying if we had different route in the while linking in the Scripture it will wait for the damn to be loaded right and then it'll execute yes so what is the difference if we added below if you had it below then also when the HTML is passed and is ready then it will execute music what is the main difference the difference is like it will download it is a better way so it'll be already downloaded by the time is remaining is being passed kind of battery is yeah yes there is also one attribute async attribute on the script that we can give yes how it is different from from different is like the downloading won't happen like just what we are like the difference if you don't have anything it will start downloading immediately if you don't have anything it will start downloading immediately and it will it will not pass the estimate if you don't add anything it will not go and pass the HTML till the script file is downloaded and executed so it will wait for the JavaScript to be downloaded and executed and then it will continue and pass the HTML if we had already discussed it will download it will start downloading but it will wait for the down to be ready to be passed yes but if we add a keyword what will happen it will start the downloading and it will start the password but it will not wait for the HTML to be completely passed it will wait only for the downloading of the Javascript file so as soon as Javascript file is downloaded and ready it will start the execution so in that time maybe half of the HTML is passed so at least it's downloaded it will start the execution it will pause like when it will start the execution it can do only one thing so it will pass HTML it will pause HTML passing and start yes we can say that and in this way it is very unpredictable like half of the HTML documents will be accessible half of the statements may not be accessible so it is very unpredictable things so we should not use that okay if if we know like it won't be accessing the door okay yeah if you don't know like if we if we know that it is not existing normal Elementary then it is the best and fastest way to do things so this is why it is available okay now there is one question what is like can we create any custom elements like your name is Avinash so can we create an HTML anything like with an Indian is it possible you can create anytime name you can create Avinash you can create anurag you can create any anytime it doesn't matter so now the question is like what will be the display value of the randomly created element the display by default all the elements are in line right so it should be in line that's correct and what is difference between the difference is the difference do the elements we can give margin left and right but we cannot give margin top and bottom to inline elements yes for log element we can give with the night every block element will start in the UI with the next line whatever wherever it is placed and it will take the width of its parent container by default if we are not giving any particular bits to the block and then we'll be taking the width of how much it required to render the content yes yeah that's true and what is like you told me we can we can give margin left and right but we cannot give up yes yes what about adding adding we can give to online elements okay so normally we give padding left and right elements height increases and width increases like if we give left and right then will increase and content will move left and right that box will move left and right based on the padding with so what will happen in this case will it move left and right with the inline elements will increase and yeah and top and bottom let's say we give only shift play property of images images are in line in line okay so on images images so they are not like that so we can give yes that's correct so there are two categories of in line elements do you know those two categories know I read somewhere like something replaceable I don't remember right now to categories come through some Source like image video iPhone and non replacement on those things we cannot give it to you okay so can you explain me what is Box model OKAY Box model is basically how the browser calculates the height and any element with including margin or border with the element height or weight or without including marginal border with basically it has two properties the content box and Border box in by default the content box is enabled in which like the height and width would not contain the margin and border of any element by water box that will be included while calculating the height and weight that's correct so do you think like Box model means all the elements are like box rectangular box does it have some something to you so so yeah all elements are like rectangular things right have you ever seen any element which does not have a rectangular shape rectangular or square shape L-shaped element only one element not two elements no no no no no no we can create a modification something but if we just give background like this okay so let's say we have one in Spanish okay and span tag is in such a way that we have put long paragraph which covers one line and half Line 1 1/2 line and if you give it a background color it will be like that right although it we cannot say it is perfectly fine because there will be one Gap but it is very weird shape it is not it does not follow the box like Box model properly so all in elements don't they do their own things okay okay all right so now let's move to JavaScript so what are different data types of primitive functions object like these okay so how do you use classes in JavaScript okay so you are afraid of classes so what is the type of that class with type of operator what is the time in JavaScript it will be okay and if you check the type of a function yes it will be objective okay if you check type of some array array will be objective okay you can start sharing your screen dial screen brightness is it visible you know not yet okay I don't know yeah this is is my screen visible he says I can you can you can zoom your PS code is it saying me function yeah so type of a function is function but function is not a data type in JavaScript Okay Google Edison function to yes class is behind the scenes is a function okay so okay let's come back to our service group can you tell me what are promises OK Google can you create a promise and resolved it when what time is clicked I have to create a promise and resolve it when a button is clicked button on our HTML elements can you repeat one more thing you have to create a promise which will be pending by default and I want you to create one button on the HTML on the page and that button is played that promise will be resolved and if you are using a wait then after I waited till then if you are using then then then call back will run so it should not resolved until that button is clear the promise I don't resolve rejected it it will be always impending state right and if I attach a document listener 2:30 you don't have to use like this you can try but our my promise to be resolved so you got it so much I promise it does not result it is coming from 16 and it is pending no no that should be resolved right and that should be resolved because you have resolved with a pending promise you have resolved a promise with another promise yes let me just reload once again whatever like online number just do control jet put put that selected thing in strings okay yeah now you can search you can play does not have to do anything with my promise yes because I have to so this is basically so but I have to find out how to This Promise let's just cancel this promise what is the state of this business you are DOT then whatever the promise will be resolved dot then automatically will be called yes it would eventually call a function that is all this promise can you promise you can like just one more minute simply call the first exactly okay so this will be resolved as soon as it is created right now right now as soon as it is created okay what about if we put that here and yes inside answer.com yes no add cash also okay dot catch on this and cancel this error also and create new change the name of this existing button and change its name to reject so there will be two buttons restaurant I guess this is good yes you can run it so this time reject the promise I want you to create promise you to have the functionality to resolve and reject okay yeah I think it is possible so first create a promise without using new promise I will you create create a promise yeah I have to check it later than Thursday I have to create sorry can you repeat that question yeah so the question is you have to create a promise without using new promise thing my function and sorry sorry just can you okay its okay so right now it is a promise with resolved so yeah so can you make it can you make it pending if you use it can I make it pending okay I'm also thinking operation is returning some value of a promise object but it is resolved with this value I have to make it ended first make it rejected first night how will you reject it it's forget about ending how should I rejected I can always throw an error yes but is the rejection so usually it will be pending if you use awake keyword and await keyword we can only use if we have a promise yes you got it so comment out the code which you have written about like I promise we have created just this is the promise object this will await for that to be resolved or rejected and and resolve it with your name like resolve it with your name first make it pending it should be pending for some time but you will resolve it not with the value of this promise but with a stream which is your name OK Google it will be pending until we click yes if you click on resolved I think we have you can you can do you can do resolved but we have not put any console log on resolving like this address is a promise so I have to no no no no I have to wrap inside another function and then call it function and then press will be consoled you can use like because of why because of the reason it is a promise is a promise I want you to use a way but don't create any function OK Google Perez you can use both places it doesn't OK Google we can use on top of and the top level bodies of modules I don't know the meaning of that so that second part is telling how you can use outside that way period models in JavaScript modules have you heard of that models we can like export and import which contains some kind of code how do you make a file model how do you make a 5245 what do you like by defining the type is equals to model year know exactly okay pause Netflix yeah okay the question is if we are using this awake keyword then the execution of that function is stopped right it will not continue yes it is so if that execution is stopped will it not block the main part of JavaScript execution is stop will it not block the main light because it is pushed in the call back and the main trade is empty or free to execute another functions from the call stack so let's say if my phone has 10 lines ok first four lines of the first first four lines of the function will be executed renovate keyword will come yes and execution will be stopped right yes yes you said that that function will go to the call like you or somewhere else and then promise it will execute some line from where it left so actually read that suspension thing after rejecting got rejection in the last 10 years old yeah but if you understand these things you will catch any problem very quickly so this is the thing with the functions the stop the execution and whenever that promises fulfilled that function will start executing from that line where it left and again if there is another event keyword it will do the same thing again and again yeah okay that's good now this was not machine coding ground we can say this is output this town but I did not send you any code Snippets now let's do some output place with module okay so I want you to create one more Javascript file console log something or something yes and some only one message yes no import this file in your website in in your main file no okay no in the Main Street yes you need to import it here what I would ask you to do is make a copy of this file and delete all the codes on this phone so that just for backup make a copy of a script just file so that it is available for your backup I want this file to be cleaned so just make a copy just to control me in the file expense that file file manager OK Google this is for your backup okay okay okay okay okay okay close this and clean this subscribe all right one first important that the script one file okay so what you have written only but we have not exported anything from here so you need to export some variable create some variable and exported yes so you can create sport script and one no cancel one more one more question like before this import line on like the right one more console just starting this Friday now I want you to get output what will come first login always on the top yes because we want to make things clear like flowers or nevertheless JavaScript do that okay I'm guessing here so this cancel you can check what is that is local news is not this index file is not right if you have written only script you need to add that extension and scripts OK Google how it is executing that line number before the start also okay so there are two phases first JavaScript would assign the memory do some all signing memory part and then the execution part sew in the first place is tends to collect all those things and yes period find me some number so in which school I want like the question is this word is going to which scope this word is going to which scope this would be in the global scope OK Google it is not a global ice we have seen it right so this is not a global what is happening here why do not a global oh this is generally the functional so it will be tomorrow yes in module we cannot first let's test statistic mode is working or not right so I'm not sure remove the wire and it will give up anything yet if you stick mode is not there it will not be there yeah so we I am guessing this answer please now so this belongs to the module not the normal JavaScript yeah so then we just hope it will go to it will not go to Global store this will go to this file scope scripture just file the model school yes model school there is something called Model school photo check that is very good things I have talked about okay okay so now let's come back to the school now now this is enough for this kind of output this question we can say that now I want you to know this is a machine on the screen you need to create a circle with random radio let's say let's say 10 to 100 pixel or we'll see how much we can give we can always customize that so they should be arranged so whenever you are clicks it will generate one Circle it will have only border it will not be filled and if you just again it will generate and if you just delete one time and when two circles are there we need to check if those two circles are intersecting each other or not you have 30 to 40 minutes of time okay just let me clarify that last part whenever the user clicks the third time and if two circles are there they both will be gone and another Circle will come yes exactly and what about the intersecting part so first week we will click on Circle will come Yes again we will click some somewhere else right here and then another smaller like very small and away from the first Circle so it will not touch the other side because we are generating random songs random radio so the question is you need to find out if that is intersecting or not okay and if normally what I should cancel it yeah you can cancel like intersecting and if you want you can also mention that how many pixels it is overlapping that is option part if you just so it is intersecting that is more than enough lyrics you have like 45 minutes you can take even more time just one last question okay I'm thinking about the approach of creating the circle just help me with that I am I will be creating a deal with some random width and then giving the battery is radius 50% to it yes that would be good okay so you can use this light on snow that would be good to give me the X and Y coordinates of the click okay okay okay okay okay what is the address that you will remember everything OK Google the radius means the half with should be a random number I don't know how to fix the minimum value of the random I generally don't you cannot fix you have to write some code to do it you have to do some calculation will always give number between 0 to 1 okay okay so the random number will always give me 0 and 1 between 0 and 1 1/11 make it 50% of create an element cost of a circle document dot create and then okay if maybe set up what is the border the radius to 50% and okay and assembly offended circle into the body and know I have two minutes to take time to consideration right now like 9:17 time is you have time to next time to 10:10 p.m. okay can I Google these types of things like you can you can you can Google 8 + 6 + 65086 okay I am I have to sign everything right at this time property with to be how to make it two times what is franchise estimated development not open child Circle skip skip okay I should give border color but I should find our Circle this is here I can give order color to it right a little bit of Define way and then pixel then pixels top is that why and left it yes it is not putting it in Center because I have two - 100 what is the value of y or less twice 2:58 and I'm okay yes okay first part is done but whenever the 30th happens I have to check if there are more than two elements on this screen more than two times and I have to remove the child just how I want one thing I wanted to ask can I remove all the elements at once or should I just use the forage Loop you can like it doesn't matter anymore ok Google and then I should create the third so those are going to be created and then this will be removed let's take one two three one two three four h we cannot use because of this notary and we cannot use for which we should we can use storage 1 2 and 3 okay second part is done the only part is we have to cancel if the second circle is intersecting intersecting with the first one and the one more part the random let's first check intersection OK Google Eddie where are you going to be storing a starting or the coordinates of each and every Circle and create it and if both are intersecting I just have to cancel it after opening the child we can unlock the second circle of the x coordinate anywhere between x + 50 or x - 50 it would be interesting with the x-axis or if it is -50x I just want a diaper first and second first Circle 0 does excellent okay I cannot do that okay I can do that this thing because first of all can you explain me what you are trying to find out so that I can okay what time do I'm trying to do is since I have to fix the radius of 100 pics of I am storing the x and y coordinate of both the circles and I would be like checking if X1 is in the reference of X2 then our x coordinate is intersecting like if x 1 minus x 1 + 30 + is in between X2 range then it will be interesting with x coordinate and same goes for the white coordinate know like how will you check that how will you check both or needs and differently because it is a circle okay it is not a square so okay if it is it was a square you can check in that way Circle okay OK Google Turkish lots of nuts intersection coordinates where it is intersecting yes yes turn on Gates lyrics but you need to explain to find out square root of the sum of a square of its arguments okay and if this distance and this distance is less than the sum of the radius then it is intersecting and is the distance between the white coordinate is this write in such a way that both intersect let's see if okay and if the sum of the radius is greater than or equal to the radius we can see that in the sum of the radius is greater than the X then it's is not intersecting is less than one minute how should I tell you like you can just move your house I think in Microsoft teams does it take a whiteboard I don't know if you can just draw it doesn't matter okay okay I suppose we have two circles here right with some radius actually we have the same radius but suppose we have the different radius on the same time so that is extra means taking the difference the distance between these two centers of the x coordinate right no it is not doing that it is doing something else it is I like √10 so obviously if the radius is lesser than the distance between the x coordinate this would not be intersecting as I can we can see here and same goes for the second part where both will be aligned vertically right yeah but it can like it can be it will not always be either vertically or horizontally yes it can be anywhere yes suppose we have like this like so when we use this thing is 0 - 61 and 50 - 511 and then we calculate the energy right angle triangle right then we can hypotenuse this would be the best distance right yes and then again we are coming we came back to that same problem the sum of the radius and the distance between the centers yes exactly so basically this thing that hypotenuse and we are doing x - 0 - 61 and Y 0 - 51 yes it is calculating the distance between two parties this is the first thing is first half of the right angle triangle second when is like when is height when it when is base and does hypotenuse will calculate the hypotenuse which will be the actual distance between coordinates yes and if the distance is less than the sum of radius which means it is intersecting if distance is less distance you can record I'm just making it prepared for the random thing if I can do that too okay and if something is true OK Google text to Y2 X11 X2 X11 X2 Y2 R1 is 50 This Is 50 oh let's leave again intersecting is false and if I just click it here intersecting is true I have 10 more minutes late -123 / 2 and Max and men are sorry 200 okay let's see suppose we have 29.14 it will give us 23 always okay so if we give at this this will always give me these two numbers 50 506 we just have to find the other one for circle with the variable is radius yes and we just started to and second service and we should provide is r155 it is not drawing or this is the circle two by two okay but we have seen here like 2 * 277 short floor mat dot OK Google it is coming but it is coming with this radius it is radius okay but height and weight is if you check in the Styles go back in the room this is not the picture yes ok Google it came true because okay we have fluids that's why no no no no no what is my radius 79 186 okay there is something else you can see can you see anything that is the problem it should not be only radius radius into two it should be radius into two okay yes because we have time we should keep radius we should not divided by 2 * 2.00 x and y coordinate yes so we should be exactly like if we miss it it will subtract less okay so if we and then subtract it then it would be missed some floating Point numbers no not floating like half of that it will it will not do the proper calculator and yes now the last thing let's let's see and test yeah that is 10 Let's test one more time it is very good play it is very good to test it yes yes what let's say put if you put one circle inside light it is not intersecting but it is still saying intersecting yes Google just checking the distance we are always assuming that others outside yes yes yes yes yes so this case you need to fix it so you can do it later but whatever the task force you can stop sharing your screen and yes let's come to the final discussion part so it was kind of interesting yeah so how like how many points will you give you yourself for this interview I sold the last bottle so 7 would be good so you get 986% generally use at my place if I get stuck anywhere so I would say this is the best interview I have taken so far one more interview I took that was also good that isn't like he also had 1.5 years of experience but I did not go into this step for for that person but this is very good interview I have taken so far one of the best no no it was really good I keep on watching your videos and I was expecting some more questions from CSS as I have seen your videos from the interview ones but didn't get that I did so that's why you were able to answer that one in line like yes yes I guess so but you always tell student to go and learn more why is it happening so yeah I go on the internet I learned it I forgot The Replacements what is it is called if you know the thing that it is there something like this to categories that is more than enough and it's very good like one thing that you can improve is it is very much you can give full name satellite short names for it it is okay for interview because you have to be fast you have to do the work still not bad name so for example coordinate instead of writing whole coordinate to c o o r that for interview is good but if you are working just give full name and it doesn't matter you can give one name that does not that is okay that is describing the thing okay so I wanted to ask Google 30 made one video but it is not published yet it will be going live in like 3-4 days so like I was to and not watched I have made one video but it is just a story you you haven't watched that video like my story video How I Learned and from farmer to software engineer yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes I did not talk about which YouTube channel I followed how I learned all the things but that that video I have recorded it will come back to still have learned from all the places where you have learned like monster from some people but through the code while writing the code I learned a lot and assess any cold steel and what's the assist Kevin Powell and like self-exploration just explore in the dev tools how things are working reading MTN that's all okay okay okay okay okay okay okay another question this is such an extent as I know something else so I will teach back in only if I know to this extent so that's why many people are requesting me to make a video on notice and I am not making because if I teach it it will be like any other course but I want to teach it in such a way that nobody has started before so I want to master it the way I know something I'm not able to give time every day consistently still I will learn any other questions Bosch
