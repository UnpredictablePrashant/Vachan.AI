hi everyone welcome you all so today we have an hour to give mock interview he is almost having three plus years of experience in manual automation now let's welcome him right so high and work welcome so how are you doing I'm doing great how about your phone yeah I'm good okay so are you ready for interview yeah okay so before starting let me just give you some instructions okay so this recorded and later I will be uploaded on YouTube and if you don't know any answer for the question so I can just ask me for the sleep or else I will tell you the answer for that question so okay and shall we start yes so yeah so have gone through your resume so maybe you have experience on Java selenium skills on those Technologies so just can you just reading yourself on Java Selena and Justin on that I can have some questions and let's say 12:10 how much baby can you give a Java 777 okay and selenium 8 877 so can you just please introduce yourself or whatever experience and your projects and on what technologies you have worked on so can you just please explain 2. 5 I know what else what is your contribution towards your project are you team member or are you leaving any team I'm not leading the team so I have 4 to 5 minutes I mean they have several criteria so whatever I can do through automation I can do it if it is not possible through automation then manual test results so usually come to me to automate certain test cases okay why do they work okay so you don't like you have experience that the totally years of experience Automation and have done manual testing initials ya perfect man have sex or two point five automation okay so the complete automation testing experience is 2.55 okay so let's say I have a Constructor in Java so how we can call the Constructor from the main method from My Mother by creating an object or if it is static then no need to create an object that I can call through a classroom is construct a static or not okay so do you know about all writing concept can you just tell me the difference between you are more methods in the class with same name overloading so we can differentiate it either by giving different number of arguments okay are different data I mean different data type to the arguments so to differentiate between the methods if it has same name it is called overloading okay Constructor basically should have the same number of class and it should not have written type okay so we can see if you want to use through parameters so we can have only one Construction are you saying something okay then what is the difference between overloading and overriding in overriding suppose we have two classes Class A and Class B if you are inheriting class A to class B supplies an object in class B and call a method which has same name so if you want to use plus okay okay so I'm asking about overriding so without a Super Key Word can we already have a method if it is from same class I mean if I have extended Class A to class B then without over I mean without a Super Key Word we can use the same method in class B without support if you super key word then will be called okay okay so what is the use of a final keyboard Final we can use it in variable method and class if he initialize any variable with the word final then we can't change it if you use final keyword in method then we can't use final keyword in a class then we can't hear it in another class okay right so then what is the difference between final and finally final is a keyword in Java and finally is the block so whenever I use whatever return in Spanish weather in Texas is passed out so the whatever it is written in final block will be executed okay so do you know about like finalized method what is the finalized method and where to use it okay so that's fine so there are three key words like a keyword as I said we can use it for variables method and classes and finally is a comes under exception handling so which is an optional block which we can use along with the try and catch and there is another method called finalized so basically that matter is come from the Base Class object class and which will be used to clear the objects like a garbage collection concert so if you want any objects or like unused objects we can simply say and if you want to clear those objects we can go with the finalists so very important so finally final and finalize all right so what is a what is the use of static keyword static we can use it to I mean the static is related to class it's not related to any object so even if you don't create an object we can directly call through classroom so here no need to create an object if you start with the word okay yeah basically when you have a static methods we can directly call from the last name without creating an object okay so can we go over a static methods Suppose there is a class in which there is a matter which is static method so can we write that message into class so if there is any static method in the parent class okay so we can still we cannot over that we can which will automatically belongs to the child class okay but we cannot override that method because which is a starting Method All right so do you know about Hybrid inheritance hybrid what are the difference what is multiple inheritance how we can achieve it if you have to explain suppose I have two parents and there is one child so that's a multiple inheritance how we can achieve it can use to exchange okay so do you know what is the reason behind that it's due to mainly there are same as in class and if we extend both classes so she will get confused whether it is from ARB so it is not possible okay so then how we can achieve the multiple inheritance and those two parents only need to be classes so those two parents can be interested so interfaces we can Implement by using a single class right yeah my we can actually parents are interfaces we can easily so for example I have a 250 as a parent and one is a class then how we can exchange them into subclass I think they say yeah let's let me just give the cats they say A and B on the interfaces C is a class I want to get all three into some other subclass so how we can write the statement in Java how we can extend them into some glass so that's it sorry OK Google interfaces all right so do you know about collections in Java I know list and a little bit more Selena Gomez so do you know what is the difference between list and set can you just tell me some differences that cannot have duplicates while the list can have duplicates okay then list can handle multiple elements effectively compared to set the elements and set the list has more methods and which we can operate methods compared to list okay okay okay so for example I have a list collection which contains some items so I want to start a specific item from the list so how we can start from its index.com so how we can extract a specific item from the set directly give you the indexes is airport will you support in set index concept is supported in set no sorry I'll store it in a string so that way I know but I'm not talking about I'm not talking about just talking about something else I want to exercise specific value or specific number from the center in case of list collection having sex in case of collection so we can actually specifically from the set because we don't have a get method there yeah yeah yeah but how can retrieve the specific value from the setup without I'm having an index how do you spell possible can I get the number of index is not possible so then how can I start a specific value from the center by using index because index is not supported collection okay all right so we have used list and set collections synonym of automation so if I want to iterate through certain number of elements do I store all the elements in set playlist ok so in the welcome sting so whether the oval is present or not so far that we need to write a program so can you try this you have any notepad I'll just give the access screen sharing so I can just now share your skin and you can just share your eclipse or not but whatever I do you want so you want to use you can just say it and you can write your program now I can see yeah just take a screenshot whether this thing is contains the oval or not okay so I'm not asking to count how many vowels I'm just asking to check whether this thing contains or not at least one no I just want to print like a yes or no for the string contains Google just print yes or if it is not just say no or cancel if it is not content then just print faulty levels I guess that's not contains what is the contains method will do contains will check particular string is present in the main street or not and inside the contains again you are calling ignore case equals is that method available in Java have you ever or previously have used this matter I have used it in listing okay okay okay okay so that's fine so I can actually write a regular expression for that okay so I can simply say with single line you can find it so you can just write a statement I'll tell you strike without if condition so I don't want anything else condition so not there so whatever logic you have written logical it is correct just check whether will it work or not okay yes there are contains a e e i o u mention all the ways okay so logically it is correct but without using defense condition so if you want to check if you can use a regular expression do you know about anything about regular expression in Java okay so let's say the same string and the same thing I want to find how many total number of Wells are present in this thing so how we can find so will it work is it correct logically correct just I want to find so I want to find total number of hours so what exactly we're doing here we're just taking string contains the I owe you and immediately your accounting but I want to check each and every character so how this will work with heels condition I'm not sure if it is correct but so do you have any ideas you have to capture each and every character okay from the beginning of the end that's the first we need to start to eat and then m o c l e w like that and as soon as we started a single character from the end you need to check that character is equal to a e i o u one of them and if you freeze equal to 804 then you need to increase account so basically how to use a phone number for whatever you want okay so in that way you can count and you need to find first length of testing according to write if a condition in the looping statement every character by using carrot method to get married to find out okay okay so let me ask some questions from selenium you say like website so what is Webdriver Webdriver is an interpreter okay so what is the root interface in selenium is design actually have you heard about search contacts in Salem search contacts okay no problem from there wherever interfaces extended and whenever again implemented by using different classes okay like Chrome driver class Internet Explorer driver engine driver class okay Firefox driver class so those are the different classes are implemented web driver interface and interface is extended from the search contacts for search contacts is Route interfacing okay so for example let's say I have given you 100 S cases for automation okay then way to start actually what are the test cases so how we can arrange the order I will I can give you okay so before starting automation let's say you have 100 S cases so now you need to automate test cases how can you give the priority to them like what is cases will automate first like 1 2 3 4 like that so what are the best cases you will automate first second third like that so how we can give the priority to the test cases so first I'll run the test cases which I'm working if they have developers so fast those test cases first then the functionality of that test cases are through that if anybody have affected so I will soon so I'll check based on priority so we will give the priority so we will prioritize the test cases you are Developer volume I don't know I'm not talking about a defect or defect play here I'm talking about the test cases let's say okay we have 100 S case in your hand so you need to automate them okay so I'm on 100 so what are the test cases you will give the high priority so first priority of the test cases what test cases you will automatic fast okay first before that I'll give it to starting up an application no no I'm not asking about any annotations or data private just leave it inside I'm just talking about you have to say 100 test cases 100 test cases if I ask you what kind of cases you will automate first but I'll check the basic car critical functionality of the application basically execute smoke cases first okay okay to check the critical functionality critical functionality of an application I was working out correctly or not okay then I'll go to then if it is possible then I'll go to regression I'm not talking about execution also I'm talking about automation scripts so at the time of execution rest of the things but at the time of automated test cases if you have 100 cases what are the test cases you will choose for automation based on what is cases for automation no problem so the criteria will be especially why we need to go with automation testing because we need to reduce the repetitive tasks does the main objective of automating the test case is right so we need to avoid the application at the same time we need to reduce a lot of time and effort in multiple cycles of testing does the main objective of automating the test cases right so if you have 100 S cases first we need to give the high priority to the data driven test cases Suppose there are some test cases which needs a lot of test data so if you do them manually right it will take a lot of time and effort right so first you need to cancel those type of test cases so first you need to automate them and then the second priority will go to the regulation test cases like Suppose there are tests we need to execute on every cycle of testing right whenever the baby is released from the devil so those test cases you need to find out those type of cases and you need to automate them that's the second priority and tired party is whatever other test cases you have so which were able to automate and you will automatically so this is actually need to follow will automating the test cases and I'm not talking about execution part of execution again happens it depends on the situation but here I am talking about the selection of test cases for automation okay okay okay yeah okay so next let me ask one more question I say suppose they say in your application there is a drop down you don't have a selected for that okay so what are you doing so whenever I enter three directions what is the element through far Loop so so if I'm looking for a particular element so I'll match it in its condition if I get the text from the element if the text message the element which I'm looking for then I'll click on that okay that's good okay so let's say suppose I want to take up to the screenshot of their application Suppose there is a failure so I want to capture the screenshot so how we can write the code for writing the capturing the screenshot there is a big screenshot okay I'll give you a screenshot of force through five 448 can I share your skin once again okay so that I have a filed okay so we will Define the file source and they will copy The Source into Target file right so let me ask one question here so here you said like take a screenshot is equal to take screenshot of driver you mention right why what is the test screenshot of driver what exactly are you doing there and type testing so why we need to do types here again because the driver doesn't have the knowledge OK Google don't know what happened to us like that okay okay so let me just clear this so the basically when you create a driver's license and you have to do type casting because take screenshot is an interface and Webdriver is some other interface so both are no no way related okay so where driver and a screenshot these two are the two different interfaces which are implemented by Chrome driver class okay so which are implemented by Chrome driver class so when you create a driver for instance before starting this you will write a web driver driver equal to Chrome driver like that right so if you create that way with the web driver and interface here you need to do that casting okay because why we need to do this because driver is an instance of interface so take screenshot is nowhere related to wherever so we need to type casting yeah suppose when you get the driver's license can you just make a statement I'll tell you okay sir no not here just before writing the method just write a simple statement I'll tell you okay so just write whatever equal to new Chrome driver so if you define the driver instance like this using Webdriver interface right so then you have to do that casting like this as I said we need to type casting because screenshot interface is different and both of us if you are created the drivers license like this you have to type casting OK Google so in that case you don't need to type cash because don't have class is already implemented screenshot interface not my point so if you define the driver instance like this you no need to type that you can directly send the driver into TS now we can just remove the time casting not required okay so that's fine so can you just explain about do you know about actions classified send text to perform okay so for example let me say OK Google okay just can you write a statement like this let's say actions actions act equal to new actions and actions will take a driver's license will take driver instant so we need to pass the time now right next to statement is the actor Dot so for example if I don't specify the perform okay so I haven't used for method just remove the performance and what will happen if not I mean it's not good till that the elements are Motel Sault why it is not completed so we have not so is it mandatory to use performance company so suppose let me say I have a requirement like this suppose I want to Define some action okay but I don't want to complete that action immediately I want to perform that action after sometime okay after doing some more steps I will perform the end of the script I will perform the action so how we can get the statement let us say mouse over action I want to perform at initially I have created that action but I don't want to complete the reaction so after some statements after a few tests then I can I want to do the most or action okay that means I want to complete that action after sometime or after completion of few statements so then how we can achieve it okay so how to write a statement when you will write the performance so then what next reaction will be popped up only when I write dot Professor so it will be complete okay so let's say after this statement I have written some more statements for three minutes and after that I want to perform the action so in that case will you write the internet will not perform will you write the entire statement again so then how we can do it so I can store it in one element this entire thing okay okay okay so how we can just tell me I'll give it to ask something so I can OK Google what is the type of the variable what is the time is it okay so let me just like this very important the building is nothing but which will build that action which will not complete an action there are two things actually creating an action performing the action okay so the bill method will just create an action which will not complete or which will not perform so once it is created which will return the action type beat so have you heard about action interface actions is a class action is an interface right so this will be actionable oh okay yeah can you define that way because action the Beloved Country is a performance yeah now you have just created an action and store that action in a way so later if you want the company that action you can just simply say ask for phone have you understood now okay so creating an action and Performing action we can do those two times in separately or if you want to do at a time you can simply say I have to move to element you can call or if you want to just create an action later you want to perform the action simply you can store that an action variable and then you can perform later okay all right so can you just tell me the difference between find element and find elements find element will return here ok Google is not available in the webpage okay so what is the return type what it will return I'll get an exception for No Such elements okay so in case of find elements same again locator I have written which will matching with multiple web development but currently that that locator is also not matching with multiple web elements so in that case what find elements will return element intercept so if it is finding multiple elements at a time okay so but located is not matching with any locators any elements on the web page so then what what find elements will return so it doesn't match rights okay have you understood so do you know some of the expert assess what are the experts are available and have used those access methods your automation so I can if I need to index under a square braces okay that is one thing okay so in selenium like how to handle the broken legs I say in your life there are some web links they are broken legs like how to handle them so every link is associated with the name okay so what I'll do is to find elements and store all the elements in one list okay so I'll write to 0. 5 7 if the responses beyond the 400 then I'll mark it as a link is broken or I'll give it as link is working so whatever the response you get response code is greater than or equal to 400 so they're all comes under broken legs okay yeah so you know automation so in the framework especially have you seen have you written something like reading data from properties file have you mentioned any properties files in our automation about properties.com username and password so all this data is available on my property is fine so I want to write a simple code and through which we should be able to load the data from the properties file and use it for your testing so how we can read the data from the properties 5 I'll send the property under the property I'll give you the part of the properties file okay then I'll load the data through okay then there is the get get get get get method I'll get the element which I want to get through okay that's good yeah okay so like you mentioned you haven't said you have used in your project we are using our own company name mention something called craft framework okay and can you just explain what exactly it is and how things will happen in this framework a crap refers to Cognizant reusable framework for automation testing center okay okay okay okay okay okay okay so there is a dedicated thing for this framework so what do this okay everything the specialty of this case it is more interesting we have to work with the keyboard driven testing okay okay no problem so let's say Get it can you just tell me what are the some reusable components you have created on your framework so it is common rights almost in every framework there will be some reusable components so just can you tell me some of the reusable components which you have created in your framework for logging but giving getting URL giving password and then username this is a common thing which will do so I have returned so that I can use to our application we have several things so that I am looking for insurance policies so under the policies there are a lot of types that I can create policy for five years and years 15 years so at 2:30 from logging to selecting and products are so in between there are several things which are common so I have stored at several I mean work clothes in a method so whenever there is a different I mean if I want to select a different product for 10 years at 5 years only at that time I'll get the test case apart from this if there is any common thing then I'll write it in a message as I told you are okay okay okay all right so how we will maintain the page elements application simultaneously page so we have started by element method so we have stored each element in a variable so we are calling that variable into a text message okay so that's good so have you seen any advantage when using page object model approach yes sir the main advantages that usability so if I want to use one particular Webb Elementary School schedule so just I think you have some knowledge and test changes so let me ask you questions so just what are the can you just tell me what are some main features from text Angie like what are the main advantages of benefits from test engine you will get we can produce results in HTML format okay we can give priority we can run test paralleling then we can provide data through data provider annotation then we can select a text message to run I can sell it to 40% and I can group the best places to write an annotation depends on so if it is any method is dependent on another minute so I can use a different song okay that's fine so do you know anything about exchange is not what is testing is not what is a use there are will be executed okay yeah that's great okay so in selenium we have something called desert capabilities just can you tell me what is the use of dessert capabilities we can give you the version of the browser if I want to run it in a particular version so I can give you environment in which environment I can run are I can give you the browser in which one to run or if there are any certain configuration that I have to follow before running and test case I can do this configuration in this capabilities okay so I have no let's say so do you know anything about headless mode of testing I've heard sir but I haven't used it I had listened to be initiated everything will happen if you just know what are the challenges you face in your automation testing so I automatically insurance data has to mimic the real user data okay so if I run several times a particular test case with several data so each time I have to give accurate data so it's difficult to decide the data every time and second thing is I have a lot of problem with the stadium have tried a different methods to handle an element exception till now I haven't found an exact like Universal solution that I can apply to eat still in elementary exception and there is one more thing whenever I start and application I'll get them up so it's like I'll get that pop up at random times it's not like picture so to handle that I have to use Auto 80 still haven't applied that I'm learning activity so these are the few difficulties challenges okay okay and how frequently will not automation cases I ran for small cases everyday and then depending on the requirement and how many manual cases we have executed so we will execute 7280 and what about reporting so how you will get the results and what kind of reports have used in your favorite report but only a popular test cases will take the photo of every floor basically every page will take screenshot so we will have really depend on screenshot and we have a backtracker okay so Under Pressure will upload all the results and the small description of automatically will be created under book tracker for each defect so will you will give you the details of who is the tester whom I want to assign will be our from Master Underwood description like very quickly so right everything about okay okay so I'm done my side so let's come to the feedback for 2.5 hours of automation experience so you answered well so I just need to improve some kind of programming logical skills okay because many people have seen many people so many people are able to answer the question from selenium testing and automation framework all these things specially for Java programming when I ask some questions from Java programming even though they are able to answer properly but when you write even ask you write a program so people are not able to write the program properly okay not able to build the logic on the spot okay so you need to improve on that particular area and apart from that in automation testing point of view okay you answered almost all questions and whatever I have asked for 2.5 years experience that is fine okay you answered and only thing is you need to just improve the programming skills all right so that's all so best of luck and are you currently working okay okay great thanks thank you have a nice day thank you thank you bye
