welcome back to another podcast episode where we help aspiring developers get jobs and Junior developers grow this episode is going to be a little bit different we did a front-end mock interview in fact I invited a good friend of mine Dan who actually interviewed me for my second developer position he volunteered his time to a brave soul in our community his name is Noah he's aiming for developer position right now and he volunteered to be on camera do a front end interview on camera I hope you like it I think this turned out really great now this is going to be released on video and audio I'm just gonna be honest if you're on audio it's not going to be as good of an experience but you are welcome to listen in I will actually include a link to the video in the description for the audio so you're welcome to listen in just want to give you a heads up but let me know what you think about this new type of interview and if you want to see more interviews like this I'm happy to do more enjoy cool awesome thanks so much for doing this my interview with us I'm Dan I'm a front end developer currently working at coinbase prior to that I was working at Albert where I worked for over 5 years I was the front and leave there and I'm kind of treating this as a friend and interview for a more let's say level position front end specifically using react and yeah thanks again for doing this so just to give you a bit of background on how this is going to go first we're going to have a few conversational questions just so I get a little bit about your background we're going to go into some more conversational questions about HTML and CSS and then we're going to start putting some of your skills to the test with some first we're going to be writing some more just straight JavaScript in a shared text editor and then after that we're going to be putting together a little project and react so for for the coding portion and really for for this entire experience it's definitely not intended that you get everything right it's not something that you finish everything it's really just to get a sense of just how you approach problems problem solving you know so I encourage you to talk out loud as you're coming up with Solutions and yeah super excited to be doing this with you introduce yourself and just tell us a little bit about yourself and your background sure my name is Noah I have been coding for the last two years teaching myself to code on the side and I'd say about 8 months ago I graduated from General assembly's full-time software engineering and yeah pretty much since graduation I've been working on multiple projects hackathons done Sprint work with with the team and I have a buddy of mine that I work with every day coding going through prep work for interviews I have done some interviews in the past I'm currently doing some interviews thank you for doing this so yeah I'm curious what what kind of got you into programming well it was during the time I was working with my previous employer I was working as a Salesman for his women's clothing company call now that's awesome and yeah I feel like a lot of folks like myself included learn because the job that you're doing isn't necessarily development but it's like you know sideways it's like kind of adjacent to it and then you slowly start picking it up so I can definitely relate to that that's awesome and have you have you kind of gone like have you decided what you want to take like front and back in Native yeah like what I started out with that and I didn't hear that and the possibilities was just at that point and after going through the boot camp I realized there's a whole package you know I'm very interested so yeah like a lot of these a lot of the things that you traditionally just do on the back end or now moving to the front end and yeah totally agree that it definitely translates yeah just out of curiosity so you know you're on a learning track what's something that you've learned recently that that you think is really cool that you wouldn't mind sharing I'll say integrating but you just learned so much at a court system are you going it is the current or the recent stuff that you've done more how can I put this are you building out like Reston points are you going like refuel is there like one technology that you're you're kind of following yes I am doing a restful routing and you know and points for for basically getting the information I want to do what I wanted to do logically so recently I you know I created an app that would go through actors database of films that they have made mashed up with another actors and get all the collaborations did so being able to you know go into the API digging for those it just gives you a bunch of tools and you can kind of do anything however you want so yeah it's pretty massive but don't do something so yeah so next up I'm going to go to some just more basic HTML CSS questions a little bit more technical if there's anything that you don't know that's totally fine and yeah definitely just treat this like you know it's a really a conversation so first question that I've got for you is so like say that you're putting together a very basic super basic web page literally just like serving static HTML what would be some things that you think to do like in the very beginning I mean the contacts as far as the content on the page go like we can say that it's just like a simple like about me page but like what are some some tags or some things that you definitely want to put on that page in order to to make it work well you know and I will just start thinking about the things that I need you I would actually wire frame and see what kind of is there any content that you know what would be going into that template so that you're not like you know repeating all the tedious stuff that goes into every webpage right so like things like you know like hero you know hero image you might have a good answer for but could you explain to me what comes to mind when you think of semantic HTML semantic HTML to me for descriptive tags tags that will you know at first glance kind of tell me what it's trying to do accessibility is another one of those things that has such a there's so much to learn like one can really like become an expert in accessibility alone and in fact a lot of folks do but yeah could you kind of explain like let's say that I don't know what accessibility is could you kind of like explain to me like what it is and why it matters right so so for example when it comes HTTP request methods are and could you give me like an example of of the difference between a couple of them sure absolutely information I'm just curious what are your thoughts on mobile first design and development when I think about when I first learned about HTML and what it is and all that stuff and then I feel like nowadays at least in my experience that's like that more like old school way of doing mobile friendly but yeah if you actually just mobile first and then you know as the screen is modified to like fit the extra viewport with available designs I will say that when you are thinking about mobile first though and you know responsive design and potentially like media queries we're going to wrap up this section with a couple of questions about CSS I'm curious can you explain to me what specificity is in CSS specificity would be do you mean like selecting you know I'm not sure I'm not sure what I understand what's the difference between a ID selector and a class selector and how might like what might I need to take into account when using them so for just you know HTML tags you can do like body parts for sure say that I have an element on the page that has a class and an ID and let's say that the class is Dan and the idea is Noah and somebody gave it the ID selector of Noah and said like color red but I actually want to make that blue how could I how can I write a selector that has a higher specificity than that that I think you can do it in a multiple ways I think the one I'm not sure if you're looking for this specific one but there's like an important but you know whatever color you want it you can put it out adding an important will definitely override the the current color that's that well yeah last question about you do you know what the Box model is and could you explain that to me a little bit I think the Box model is that every element yeah I'm not 100% sure that you can work off of and if you know that you can rearrange them to look exactly the way that we wanted to you can also align them to each side or talk a lot of different things great job so far that that wraps up the first portion of the interview next up we're going to go into the vanilla JS part of the interview we're just going to write some functions we're not even going to run these functions so it's not about you know making sure that they work 100 it's really just about taking some problems that we have and seeing if we can't solve them so you've got a link that I sent over if you could just share your screen real quick we can go in there but yeah so here's some of the bunch of prompts and empty functions the ideas that you're going to fill out the the body of the empty function and then underneath every function there's a little example of like how we might use it and there's a little common saying what we would expect so if you have any questions about any of the prompts or really anything at all I'm definitely here to help you out but yeah why don't we get started with the first one and let's write a function that takes two numbers and returns to some of those numbers so we have a function here and I guess I'll use this function down here you got it ok Google all of them so for instance here 2 plus 3 plus 4 plus 5 should return 14 so would this be like any any amount of numbers yeah so if you can implement it with any amount of arguments that's great if if we want to convert it to an array that's totally fine as well well I'm just I'm just wondering like how I would make it so that the parameter knows how many to expect is there a way that we we know how many to expect so there are actually a couple of ways and I'm just going to dive in here real quick so there's there's the old school way and then there's the new way and the old school way I'm just going to open the arguments keyword in a function is actually like an array of the arguments I think a keyboard in JavaScript function that is is an array representation these days you can say in the function argument dot dot dot or whatever you want to call this is the name is an important into an array so cool I'll just I'll delete that and so now ours is an array of the numbers that were passed in right so here I would then you know it over the array of the elements of the numbers and so you don't need the leading dot dot you can just say oh okay cool thank you if you scroll up just a little bit and then what this would actually do with the arguments below is a would be too because that's the first argument you would be three because that's the second argument and then ours would be an array of four and five because those are like the rest of the arguments but yeah that lets you do some pretty interesting things yeah interesting cool let's yeah let's see if we can do this next one so this one we want a function that takes two strings and it returns true if the second string is in the first string in a case and sensitive way and I would say if we want to see if we if we don't want to solve for the kids and sensitive way we can just solve for like the case sensitive in which case string includes and the in the example would return false but yeah if you can think of a way to do this in in a case insensitive way that would be great right so then we have two parameters yeah all right so here I would I guess taken to take me in two strings so stream one and string two and I want to check if the second string is in the first is that correct yep and then there's a there's a message and make everything that's inside there yes so okay so I guess my question is what what calling string string one two lowercase modified modify the the first string or no I'm not sure about that I would have to just check the end I'm not sure yeah I'm not sure I guess I can just tell you let's do one more but I'm curious what is the next three songs I feel like let's see here so you got get names which the intention is to return an array of the value of the objects that have that name in them we've got get largest number index which the idea is to return the index of the largest value in the array and then we have this this last one is the heart of all of them which is to return a function that lets us call if you can see the example here we want to be able to say like a weight delay and then a number of milliseconds and then Implement that in some way shape or form so out of those three do you have a preference for one that you'd want to tackle manipulation and more array manipulations I think with the async function I understand what it's doing there it's basically setting a timer and then after we want to do something a little more than the last song again names here is if we look at line 49 start being called the ideas I get names takes an array of objects and it returns an array of the values for the name property of those objects if they have one so as you can see here the objects being passed have a equals 1 so in the in the return we don't expect anything we really expect you know the strings Jane Mark and Sophia so yeah the idea is given an array of objects returning an array of the names of any objects that have that name property does that make sense of objects and that's what we're looking for is within the array of objects we want to see if the if the if the key that equals to name and if so then we return the value of whatever that is right so we're going to need to look over the array and check inside that move if the object contains a property management and prototype chain so it's just a little bit safer and in my opinion but awesome this has been honestly great so far and yeah so why don't we yeah if you just want to give this a save and then jump into Source / app and then now we can start talking about the next portion of the interview which is going to be building out a bit of a that's going to be a react project the idea is that we're going to be played next like thing and I'm just going to go over the the requirements there on the right so we're going to be implementing a polka dots and I think at least I Look to play some visual idea of what I'm going to be working on so why don't we click the designs and design specs on the right hand side so it's in the sorry it's the link in the yep so can't stress this enough it's not about making it look perfect this is literally just an idea for like how to or like how it will end up looking if we get to the if we get through the styling portion that said definitely more interested in building out the functionality so the general idea here is that we're going to have some sort of Select at the top that lets you pick a Pokemon and then based on the value that is selected we're going to be loading a Sprite of the Pokemon its name and the little description and then at the bottom we're going to have some we're going to have a couple buttons next in previous where if you click you know so if you're on Bulbasaur which is Pokemon number 1 I believe going to next would just load up the second Pokemon the idea is that you know previous would take you back here's the general styling that we want for this but like I said definitely prefer to focus on functionality so if we go back to the code sandbox yeah so that's generally what we're going to be building and then yeah so here's the the requirements is one having a drop down that has a list of the OG 150 Pokemon by the way I've already written down some helper API methods so a lot of that's taken care of for us but we can still dive in there and look at you know what those methods are and how they work but yes we want to drop down of the original 150 we're going to display a card that displays an image the name and a brief description of the currently active Pokemon and then we want previous to next buttons that when you click them it'll you know go to the next Pokemon or the previous Pokemon depending on what button you picked the featureless is flexible if you have an idea for something you'd like to add feel free to suggest it is like I don't actually care that you know how to implement a Pokemon or a pokedex it's really just about seeing how you approach problem-solving and react so yeah if you have an idea for anything let me know and this says you know the Design Center have to be exact but there they are and we actually already did the select because styling those can be kind of a pain so that's in components / select yeah there it is this would be too much to like expect somebody and like why yeah right but yeah so why don't we first let's go into the API and kind of just walk through those things together and by the way in terms of actually implementing this you can just you know remove the prompt from the return and then just replace it with whatever so online 16 words you can just return whatever it is that you want to you know call the thing that you're ultimately building so if you do like return no or whatever it'll just start from scratch but actually so on this page you can see that online one we have import get Pokemon list and get Pokemon description and online 5 and 13 we have this function that's kind of showing you what the return value is from both of those things so get Pokemon list returns a list of the original 150 Pokemon and then get Pokemon description for a given Pokemon should return in the description so there is a console in the prompt and you should be able to open that console and see what those yeah there you go so the first one is get Pokemon list so that returns a list of yep so it's it's name and that URL I guess and that's what that looks like and then get Pokemon description for Bulbasaur right now but if you want to scroll down and take a look at what that response looks like it's it's that and then if we want to go into the actual AP hi folder we can see those functions nice so yep that's that one's pretty straightforward and I don't think that really anything has to be done there I'll get Pokemon description right now it's saying Pokemon species / 1.2 get the current number somehow don't worry about the regular that's just normalizing some wonky formatting that's coming back from the API and then finally get Pokemon spray URL again is returning Bulbasaur but that just Returns the URL that points to the image of the Pokemon so I guess can I ask you a question about this like this is the Bulbasaur one and I guess that's you know going to be the first entry of that array that we're getting from the API the list so if this is like 149 they will get you know me too or whatever the last one is so that is actually so online 22 if you see the URL is pokey pokey API at the end of Pokemon is actually what selecting Bulbasaur it's not okay for instance flash one but if you change that to I think the next one is Ivysaur we would actually want to get slash Pokemon species / 2 and I do want to say that the get Pokemon list does return them in order so if you select the Pokemon using if we look at good Pokemon list for instance and so you've got Ivysaur open right that is the that's the second item in the array that is actually the Pokemon with the number to so online 22 here if we were to change the one to a two we would actually get the description for Ivysaur instead of nothing else the number of changes yep exactly so like if you need any help with anything at all like where to start or really any clarification around anything just let me know so I guess this is an image so there is one more utility function that would also need to be updated to be able to take any any number select Google so technically we have and if I guess the better question is do you have maybe like 20 to 25 minutes to to tackle this I don't know that I can finish this intentionally made it so that this will take longer than the time we have if you were to finish it I know there's a mock interview but we just give you the job immediately we have like more more than enough for you can I put 25 minutes on them and we'll just work on this for the next 25 minutes see how far we get sure perfect styled version of the regular HTML select so it has the same API so basically what you have to do in order to render the inside of it is give it options yeah so this this is not doing play anything other than styling the native browsers collect so I mean if you go to mdn if you if you search like mdn select you can see what the API looks like perfect perfect so yes so there is a specific way to do this in one second in which is so you're kind of music you can't just wait in a regular you know in a regular component so yeah we're going to need to as you said like you use affect and probably some states then we can use you stay probably to update the value and we want to await the Pokemon list and the way that you would do this is so which takes a function and you only want exactly so you only want us to happen once so you can pass that empty dependency array and you can kind of yeah you could do this a couple different ways if you need help thinking about which way to go like I said something like that because I want I want I guess a variable to hold it and then set up set an alarm for 9:00 p.m. and this is kind of if you don't mind I can totally help you out with this thing cuz this one's kind of more specific but you can't you have to use a weight in an asylum actually want you to make this like the outer functioning function because then it'll really so what you can actually do is just write a little function that wraps exactly what you've got inside that you can call it like like function like get data or something and then so for Matt yeah map will actually be yes and I know map will take the key and the key in the actual elements so one thing that I would do here is wrap wrap the entire JavaScript would it be okay to also like it down here yeah absolutely great and now we have a list of all the Pokemons yeah awesome and then I guess I don't know if that means it's enough time to kind of take this further but I know you have the design here so we would want this card here so yeah this one you know you're kind of on your own to implemented however you think is awesome if you want to drop it directly in the app.js by all means if you want to make it a custom component it works as well cool so I'm pretty sure we put Pokemon names and then the card here or no not outside the select card from I think it's called if I think about the API utilities they all kind of expect a number which is like the currently selected Pokemon number to store the currently active Pokemon so that we can then so we can see what we're working with you know so okay so we do get that and now if if you wouldn't mind on 9:30 if you could just cancel and then if we change the select it will I assume give us the the value of the so now we have the name the value of the name right yeah one thing though is that these are going next and since Google utility API calls to to get this data right right now so we can go back to work it would be a string so that should actually be fine because all of the API calls don't actually yeah they don't care if it's a string or a number right right so now we can say sets to be that value an API utilities and if you just wrap up get Pokemon Sprite URL in curly braces because it's aimed export OK Google that's totally fine no that's on me I probably just wrote the wrong URL but love it it's great work so I think our Pokemons and rendering it obviously like well I mean first of all obviously we're in a time crunch and like I said I can't stress enough how this is like I intentionally put together a bigger project than the time allows we've got State Management we've got looping through an API response to like build this thing out we're rendering an image that's changing dynamically based on on the current Pokemon I'm super happy with how everything went so yeah why don't we call it bring Don back in here and have like a grease hello how's it going I think it's going pretty well I think so too that was awesome I like kind of just watching from behind the scenes looks like your camera is a little Frozen down really I'm going to turn it off and turn it back on okay see if that solves it now you're still frozen with this but no how does that feel interview yeah I know I mean honestly that was that was pretty clear and I think honestly you bring up a really good point around using just tooling that that you're not used to I feel like that's something that is super common especially now that interviews are happening more remotely there's I mean even code sandbox specifically so I've actually done interviews in code sandbox before and one of the things that trips me up is that prettier is always like enabled by default so like anytime you save it like formats your code which is great I love prettier to death but even stuff like that can just kind of like trip you up a little bit so I think part of yeah part of the interview practice even is like getting used to working with like tooling that isn't necessarily your own in the past I've even had to code in like Google Docs which is like absolutely bonkers couldn't even tell that you were like having some problems with the idea that seemed pretty smooth well any final feedback from yeah for sure so okay so I think the first the first two parts of the interview absolutely crushed I was really position which you know I'm really looking at this from a friend in position like you know your answer is were like very knowledgeable in some cases to the point where I like almost wasn't expecting it like giving like detailed responses for like how they did what they are in and what they do like that was absolutely awesome I feel like just in general you were so easy to talk to and like you know you kind of like glad the conversation in ways where you would like answer a question but also give some like additional feedback or additional context which was I always think that that's just great something that I personally like to do in interviews as well because like it's not really about the question it's just about like the conversation and like the things that interest you and that sort of thing so I took some notes down yeah like your answers for like what semantic HTML is for what accessibility are like they were very like in depth and mostly like understandable so I almost feel like if I was like thinking of myself as like a Layman or like maybe like somebody who's less technical like you'd be a great person have on the team to be able to explain Concepts to folks that that really need to understand them at a more like base level which that's a skill that I personally think it's super invaluable because a lot of times developers can kind of explain sometimes it seems like you were unsure about something and then you have to be crushed the answer such as CSS specificity like what you're like I don't know but then give like explained it exactly exactly how it is I think in the JavaScript portion so you pretty much nailed like all the problems one of the things I noticed just in general which this is super teachable but you you tend to lean on like for Loops which one of these days I was kind of just expecting like a high order functions like filtering in mapping and stuff but eventually that kind of came through in the react portion so that was cool you know just like the minor I feel like lack of knowledge when it comes to async functions which again like super like learnable like that's definitely like on the more like Advanced side of JS but I did I did notice that you know there were maybe some some holes there that we would have to like if we were to bring you on board we'd have to like you know help you understand how those things work in a more deeper level but then yeah I project I feel like I got a good sense that you know react at Lakeview working level and again there's things that we would probably want to you know it would probably have you like pair with more like senior developer so you can come to some of those Solutions maybe a bit more quickly or in a bit more I guess what I'm trying to fetch data from an API I'll wait the response and then update some state in order to be able to use it cuz like react isn't going to let you write a async use affect function directly you can't use a weight in a component so they have to know how to react like jewels that sort of thing also like not knowing select is like truly whatever because like I feel like these those are the sorts of things that you just kind of like do maybe like three or four times and then it's but yeah it was it was interesting seeing your process got going from the data fetching to a input and having to like update some State based on to be totally honest I wish you would have gotten to the solution a little bit more on your own but at the same time given how the rest of the interview went if this if you know if I had XYZ company and we were hiring for a like Junior to mid-level developer I would say I would kind of put you like in the middle like definitely more than Junior probably a little bit under mid would definitely want somebody like you to be to work with a more senior developer on your first like few features for sure just like you know drive home some of the things some of the areas that I kind of found that were a little bit more lacking but that's said I would yeah if this is a real interview at say like let's move on to the next level for sure I wasn't expecting to hear that actually so I'm surprised too soon yeah no 100% so the general sense that I got is that you know the Core Concepts which is ultimately me much more important than like the finer implementation details so I think you have like a really solid foundation for getting paired up with somebody more senior and after like you know after a few months of like caring features together you being able to like go off on your own which is really like that's that's what I expect from a minute I think you yeah you totally killed it normally like yeah thinking back to when I was hiring back in the day for somebody in this position I wish we would have been talking about and that's a rat I hope you enjoyed this I'm actually going to leave Dan Noah's links their LinkedIn links in the description feel free to reach out to them and thank them for doing this if you like this video be sure to like it share it with at least one more person in fact if we get 250 likes I'm going to ask Dan if he'll do more of these I'll see you in the next podcast episode happy coding everyone
