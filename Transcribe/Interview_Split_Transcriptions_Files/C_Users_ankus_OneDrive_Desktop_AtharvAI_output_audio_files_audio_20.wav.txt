okay so before going to start let me just give you a few instructions and then we will start okay so this is going to be walking to you and which is also will be recorded and will be uploaded on YouTube later and because others also learn something from it and the second thing is and don't be nervous and be confident okay and yeah so let's start with this are you okay with that yes are you fine okay great so based on your profile I have just consider your profile as a fresher okay and also mentions skills like manual testing and then I will write these are the basic three different skill set to mention your resume so let me ask some basic questions because I consider your profile as a fresher so let me just go with some basic questions right okay so shall we start now yes so can you just introduce yourself what is your experience and qualification what is your skill set myself niharika I'm basically I have completed my VTech in computer science in Italian Institute of Technology of 6065 and coming to my house so what do you know about sdlc software development life cycle Fallout 4 developing a new software okay and what are the different phases of including sdlc the face requirement Gathering requirement Gathering analysis design coding testing installation and maintenance support comes in this face 18 will be there with the business analyst along with the design Architects along with the Architects HR and the finance team where they will do the feasibility study of the technical feasibility study resource feasibility study as well as the finance feasibility study after after they do the once the feasibility study is done here the project manager will decide whether to take up this project or not based on the requirements and after after taking up the project the next process is the design phase here the senior Architects just tell me just very high level action so I don't need any internal what are the task will be done so what exactly happening the requirement what will happen in the design and coding testing and so let's say in the requirement analysis space mainly business unit project managers or product managers these people will be involved and during the day the design and development so development people will involve so they do some kind of design like high level design low level design and accordingly they like the code during the coding phase and then testing will come into picture and after completion of the testing so then we'll production will start okay so this is very high level information about sdlc you know need to go in detail of sdlc until until unless I ask the question okay if anybody asks you explain in detail about is you need to explain what are each and every activity will be done in the stairs okay so what do you know about sdlc so do you know about STLCC sdlc what is the steel it is a software testing life cycle okay it is a process which is following processes talking about enters software development process from the requirement to deal production but is a part of development process so sorry part of testing process okay it is talking about only testing phase like during testing what you do we will understand the requirements right and then we will write the best case that's part of Designing and then we will execute the test cases and then finally we will get from the test and we will report to the developer so these are all activities during STLCC process there's a part of enter is deals okay great so do you know what are the different models are available or what is DLC like software development process models what are the different models are available so do you know about remodel okay so how the development and testing activities we will do the functional testing but initial levels like in the requirement play some design phase how the testing will happen in the model we will review the documents so static testing is done so what is static testing testing any software based on the documents is called husband of testing right but in the face of requirement analysis or designing by the time we don't have any software only we have to talk about so by the time you don't have any software to be ready until next time software is not ready right so during requirement it is unfair so we will review the document we will test the documentation like the documentation means what the documents again talk about the software how it will be what are the different features should be there right so we will verify whether the documents are currently return or not completed or not so that is comes under static testing because we are going to test only documentation part until unless the software is ready right once the software is ready once the development is started then software will be ready then we do Dynamic test so there we will exactly test the software okay so that's the basic difference so in the Border like a development and testing will happen early like a while development is doing unit testing a unit like development is happening you need testing will be done so integration testing and then system testing and you editing so these tests will happen depends on the responding documents like we have SRS document like we have a design document then we have a unit test plan then we have integration test plan right so System test on those documents we will perform the testing in the world okay so do you know about anything of functional testing what is functional testing functional testing what is testing the functionality of the behavior of an software okay so Suppose there is an application so how we will start functional testing how will perform functional testing Suppose there is no problem so there is an application and you have to start functional testing on the application so how we will start what is your approach how do you perform functionality so we we will start and what you will refer before connecting functional testing because right for we cannot directly start functioning right if you want to test in application you have to know something you need to have you need to know something about application right until unless you know that application you cannot directly start testing right so how do you perform functional testing so how we will start first 30 will be done after we will prepare the test data for the input so will you prepare test cases first or test date of first kisses the functionality right once you understand the functionality then you start creating the test cases and if there is any data is required for the test cases then you will prepare test cases okay all right so the next question is a suppose I have given an application and you who is that application but I have not provided to you any documentation so you don't have any documentation by hand I was right for I have given an application so how to test that application what kind of testing you will do we will do the exploratory testing we will explore the application by using the application and we will get to know the functionalities means without having any documentation so we will just explore the functionality it's basically learning the application and then we will start testing okay so what is regression testing testing testing testing the modules the modified models and also if there is any if there is any changes because of because of the change in one model whether it is affecting the other models are not we are testing that in the regression testing okay great so sometimes the developer made some changes in the bill so because of those changes the existing functionality or some other functionality we should not be impacted by the changes right so sometimes developer may add a new functionality or they will fix existing box right so because of that they do some kind of code changes and that should not be impacted another functionality for that we will test the existing functionality also along with the new feature and back fixes so there's a command center regression testing so perfect okay so how to write a test case so what you will refer like the test case so what is the input for so let's say you have a project okay and suppose to write some test cases and what is the information you need to have before getting the test cases what you should know so you have to know the requirements yes you need to know the requirements and where you will get the requirement where you will understand the functionality of our application until unless you know the functionality you cannot write the test cases right so where exactly will get the function where you will know the functionality on what basis you will understand the functionality using the scenarios yes yes we will prepare the test because you have to write even if you want to write so you need to know something right you need to know the function of application so we can see the functionality how we will know the functionality of application in the SSundee SRS means a software requirements specification and functions specification requirement which is contains a detailed documentation which is in understandable format more clinical format and testers developers will able to understand okay that's all if far is functional requirements specification document based on that you can understand and if it is also sometime contains the use cases I use cases what is the use case do you know what is a use case is also part of a requirement by seeing the use case you will understand what is the input what is an action what is an outcome so you will review all these things and depends on that or based on that you will understand the functionality and then you will form the test scenarios and then you later test cases okay that's a process is there any difference between what is the difference between test cases is the indeed documentation talk about how to test like what are the different steps are involved what is an expected what is an actual result so these things are included in the test case the best attraction which we need to perform on the application and then we will check the expected and actually is exactly equal or not so those things will be included in the test but test is very high level against we can divide it into multiple test cases so what is can have one or multiple test cases okay great so good answer and let me ask if you want more questions what is the difference between priority oh priority is is the urgency of fixing The Defector reality is the how much impact it is it is on the business okay business of the customer okay so see what is basically talking about the seriousness of the defect how it will impact the business right and priority is nothing but how soon we need to fix that issue is basically talking about the time okay good okay so what is the defect life cycle can you explain the difference make the sign and once it is assigned they will develop developer will fix the defect and it will be assigned like after fixing it will be your status has it fixed and they will send it send back to the test for testing then test this effect and if it is a fixed then he will close the defect and if it is not it fixed then he will send it so do you know about agile process and Basics is there any advantage when you compare with other Motors one day of agile process original model process the communication in the team is good the communication will be good and also here there will be a less documentation documentation of that we can provide the delivery soon and quality will be good okay so in agile process so customer no need to wait till the long time okay so he will get the very frequent releases let's say there is a huge functionality is 10028 for all 100 ft to be completed as soon as we completed some piece of software we will test it and we will give the demo to the customer and if he's okay we will release that piece of software to the customer and finally he is using it and on top of that we will have three more features and again we will start and testing process so customer is mainly no need to wait for long term to dentist office so we can deliver a piece of software in intervals okay that's the main advantage of aging process okay great so let me just give you one scenario so I can just tell me how we can test it and let's say in Internet banking applications you want to send a money to some other person so we need to provide you need to enter some memo right so that I should be limited per day let's say you can send out between 20 and 10,000 maximum 50,000 so you cannot send more than 50,000 so starting like 10,000 minimum amount maximum amount 50,000 you can send per day okay so how we can test how we can test that field we can test this by applying the testing techniques analysis okay okay so how we will test it by using BBA mobile analysis yeah we will check with we will check with the minimum what is the 10,000 and and 10000 - 1/6 and 10000 + 1 will be checking for these three letters for the minimum and when it comes to the maximum again we will check with the maximum that is a 5000 and we will check for the 50,000 - 1 and 50,000 + 1 so we have to check 6 mm that will cover all the boundaries okay now let me let me just give one scenario so I need to upload a file in my application I need to upload a file and that's basically an image file okay so that is accepting only dot PNG file and the size of the maximum size of the file is one MB so I should download only one name is one named B and that should be dot PNG exchange so it should not allow any other extension or it should not allow if the size is exceeded one empty so can you just give me one to test case and one negative test case for this do you know what is positive test and negative test is positive testing negative test case or testing okay so first let me tell me what is positive testing testing a software by passing the valid input according to the customer requirements so that is positive and negative is passing the invalid the input which is not according to the customer requirements right so now just tell me one positive and negative test case for file upload so my requirement is file share should be back from one named it should not exceed and always file extension should be dot PNG it should not accept any other extension of the fights now tell me one positive test and one negative test case for that the image should be should be in the format of the so that is what is the positive and negative is we are to check to check that the size of the image is greater than 1 MB okay so that is a negative and also we can also check the extension right if you upload file with less than one number successfully if you upload the file get that one is native to similarly the extension if you upload the file with the uploaded with without testing so can I ask some questions from java I think you are still on Java I'll ask some basic questions okay and yeah so you are already mentioned your profile you know some Concepts support object oriented programming Concepts so can you just let me know what are the oops concepts are supported by Java yeah and capsulation okay and what else what about the class objective so the first one glass of red apps so these are all different object-oriented programming Concepts okay so can you just tell me the difference between method overloading and overriding overloading and overriding it should have in the method the parameters should be of the Justin Bieber first of all what is overloading what is is the two parameters we cannot create again but if you still created two parameters again we need to change the data type or order of the parameters so each and every method should have a different definition you should not be a unique that's called method overloading so when you come to overriding sew in method of riding is Possible only with inheritance at least we need to have a two classes right that means whatever method we created in the parent class the same method if you recreate again in the change class by changing the implementation which is basically called as over already right so overloading is possible with single crochet is Possible only with inheritance at least we need to have two classes then overhead is possible but in overloading we will change the only parameters method name is riding we should not change the definition didn't type name of the method number of parameter we should not change we should change only the implementation so these are the basic differences between overloading and overriding what is the use of a Super Kmart when do you use super keyboard in Java how are you okay no problem you created one method and in the sales last you overrated that method okay now when you create an object of the jail class when you call that method only method will be called because there's a latest matter you have implemented but still if you want in the immediate parent class method yeah right so then we will use a super cute like we can invoke the immediate parents we use super cute he is basically used along with the inheritance concept okay so what is an abstract method in Java what is an abstract matter which doesn't have the complete complete implementation so that method is called right so the matter doesn't have any implementation just only if you have only definition which is called as abstract matter so where we can create abstract methods in Java where you can create normal class can can I can I create abstract methods in a normal class so maybe we can create yes interfaces we cannot we can create abstract class and where else what else where else we can create abstract class right so we have an abstract class if you are so even interface also we can create an abstract methods and those methods we will Implement later by using some other class okay so in interface implementation is not possible so we need to create another class and then we will Implement those abstract matters so any idea about collections do you know anything any collections like a list of hash map okay no problem okay so let me ask a few questions from SQL so do you know SQL so how much rating you can give on a scale 1 to 10 5:00 so let me just ask if you guys because you mentioned like you have knowledge on South Koreans and joints and you know some basic card email commands a simple way I'm going to ask let's say I have a product table if you have a paper and then you can just write it down or if you have a notepad is still you can write it down no problem going to show you simple a product table which contains only two columns okay and product name or the other column is a price product and price only two columns one calling me is having product name and other call is called Product price so there are different products so some products are having same Price Rite some products are having a higher price on products are having low price so I want to display the data from the stable like expensive products like whichever the product is very expensive I want to display the data of that particular product they have 10 items in your table each item is having some price let's say one item is 100 rupees other item is 200 rupees or 500 rupees or 1000 now I want to display the item which is having highest price or which is very expensive single table only two columns select OK Google how to get most expensive product or high value product and the product which is having high price and you compare with the rest of the products okay then select the product name from the products table where Max or Max of the product price Max function how to use this Max function can we write can you achieve this with single or do we need any support for that we need we need some product right now what is my requirement yeah I want to just display the details of the product not only Magnum yes so that we will get the maximum price and that is the subway subway equal to in the South Korea's of fries from the products table so first we need to know what is a maximum price right what's the highest price in the table and once you get it we will use the maximum price and then get the details of the product which your products are having that price we will get it so select mags price from the product table is a and the output from the query will be the input of the outer body so in order for we will justify the selectors table or select the product name or price from product so we cannot do this by using Safari right okay so can I ask one more question so it's a simple having customer service customer ID is a customer named and our customers are belongs to different countries like one customer is belongs to UK us or any other countries now I want to face the data from this table like each country how many customers are there so let's say I have a table in which there are five different customers are from US country right so now I want to find out from us how many customers are there from UK how many customers are there from Germany how many customers that means each and every like country wise I want to find out total number of customers from the customer service again single table just have a few columns like customer ID customer if you want to you can just write down your people just have what's my name's other column is a customer countries countries so you can have some duplicate country also us is repeated 23 times UK is repeated to three times now from the US country how many customers are there from UK country how many customers are there that means each and every country how many customers are there in the table I need to find out how we can write the query select for all the countries each country how many customers are how many customers are there in each and every country music I'm not getting no problem no problem so here we have a different countries I said each country how many customers are there how many customers how we will find out by using counter will give you how many so each country how many customers are there each country means whenever you say each country is grew by welcome so Group by country we need to use so the final Curry will be select count star comma country from customers Group by country so countries last question so when do you use joints oven there are two different tables not only to even if you have one table we can write a selfie John right so we can create an alias of the table and we can create so joints will be used if you want to get the data from one or multiple tables if you want to join the tables we can go with the joints okay so that's all from my side so whatever you know so you answer perfectly fine and from manual testing you answered everything almost a job and just Java you need to prepare well so mostly I have not asked any practical questions from java but you need to prepare for a practical questions like program oriented questions and questions are fine so you answered well whatever you know you answered well only thing is practical questions you need to prepare from SQL or you need to prepare Curry okay so critical questions are fine but I need to prepare some more calories okay that's all from my side all right so thanks for attending the interview so prepare well and if possible again I'll take one more mock interview in future okay if you are prepared well thank you very much thank you thank you
