hey everyone if you want to see what a back-end interview is like I just hosted a mock back an interview for the interviewer I invited on Scott he was my boss's boss I think sitio and then eventually became VP of engineering he manages a pretty large team right now and he has hired hundreds of Engineers he's very kind very kind-hearted and very candid which I appreciate both sides of that but we invited on Eric the brave soul who is an aspiring developer definitely with an interest in backend from what it sounds like and he decided he wanted to get a taste and feel for what a back and interview was like so I hope you like it and enjoy all right so what I like to do here is one thing about no more than 10 minutes I wanted to learn it all I gained a little bit of experience from that but I wanted to gain a bit more hands on experience and kind of do my own thing and do production code so I took the leap of faith and I decided to join a new camp boot camp which was a coding boot camp and they offered a python back-end program which I started in early October and I've been learning and growing since then great so the blockchain start you didn't have any programming experience prior to that know nothing prior to that that was pretty much my first my first language I learned wasn't actually Python and it was actually a smart contract development language called solidity and I did get a little bit you know 30 with that learned a little bit of this you know syntax but other than that nothing really major interesting one of that look like what was the learning path of that like for you was it self-driven did you have Learning Materials oh so most of it was someone tutorial base but I did play around with the production code bass a little bit so I got to you know gain a little since the land so see how the Smart Country development process goes how these contracts interact with different contracts and how it communicates with the blockchain I honestly will say it was a very valuable experience for me so solidity itself is very syntax similar to JavaScript so I mean we all know how JavaScript can be synthetically so it was definitely not the most friendliest first language to learn for sure which is why I kind of thought maybe it's time for python but that's that's where I'm at I now and would consider myself a python Maxi but I do appreciate both languages and Frameworks now have you ever seen that Meme of the the JavaScript reference manual on the JavaScript the good parts and it's like this okay I haven't seen an exact one but I feel like I've seen derivatives difficulty generating Revenue definitely difficulty with getting the right guidance and help that I needed at the moment you wear a lot of hats that's the cliche that we all hear you know and I think in the moment I was looking for a bit more guidance a bit more Hands-On a bit more you know I want to be able to do my own code I want to actually hands on the keyboard as opposed to learn this tutorial learn that tutorial and you can play around with this code base but nothing will be pushed to production that you touch so it's spelled like oh what am I really doing you know what am I actually learning so now I'm like I'm really glad I did with the boot camp and what have you done something 50 by start up in September and then I took a few weeks off and then I joined the boot camp early October and went through the going to the boot camp now right now my biggest side project I'm working on is a Spotify account so it's a truck but it's something that I really been enjoying the process of learning so I've been spending more of my time doing that and on another side project that I'm working on is also playing around with smart contract development but not with solidity it's a different it's more of a Python language called Viper and hopefully I'll be able to make my own smart contract coach base very cool just in terms of the work that you're doing getting into the application development side of things what's what are you enjoying this may sound very quickly but during those bouts of frustration and aha moments and I know that we all know those are the moments where in the in the in the midst of it you want to bash your head against the keyboard and you wonder why you got into this mess but after that that that that that light bulb goes off you you begin to realize this is why and and then you know those that you know light bulb goes off and you realize oh this is why it makes perfect sense logically synthetically but then up until that moment you know it's very frustrating but it's nothing nothing like it it's very cathartic I I can't imagine doing anything else it's such a intellectually stimulating rationalizing it's really a different way to look at the world I would say and I honestly couldn't have chosen a better career path well yeah not totally get that the point that I was about the thing that I've always enjoyed and mainly because definitely the feeling that I will always be three steps short or you know one step short or something it's never it's never the piece of technology well I mean sometimes you know but 99% of the time it's something that I did wrong I mean that I ever looked and as a perfectionist you know it's definitely difficult to let that ego go and you know just keep digging and keep me searching and keep asking for help and kind of building that kind of sense of it's okay you know you'll learn and grow from this experience whether whatever and understanding that it's all part of the Journey of learning and growing their you will never find someone that mastered a language or Master the framework everyone's learning and growing and we just comes with experience in time yeah and I don't talk about this before the confidence is the hardest thing to to build my coaching to junior level Engineers that don't work for me because I can't tell you to work outside of your work hours but to just always have a project always something always something that you're on the side because it helps to get a lot of that out of your system fast and can't disagree with you like I said I want to spend about 10 minutes just kind of having you thank we need to follow three rules each player and I gave a list of players here it's just an example Barney Wilma Fred Pebbles and Bam Bam each player and they can only so no rules on what the input looks like just that we are capable of carrying things up so whatever you're comfortable with there but what I've done here is put together a quick python example where the simplified in terms of pairs of strings and stuff you know for the Barney's to Wilma Fred gives to Betty Etc so I'm excited to do these things however you're comfortable right so otherwise I'll let you just going to get started and let me know you know what you need to go through ahead and read it to myself giving a list of players pair up players so that each player okay or whatever so my first thought is to begin with a some sort of to iterate through this list of players and to so I want to be able to somehow first categorize these players initially I was thinking about doing a some sort of so that way I can iterate through and assign each player to a different player so you know Fred with Walmart or Barneys my second thought is I could do that or I could do for first a sign this list and put it into an empty dictionary so I could do Fred Fred Fred with someone and then someone my thought process right now is going search the latter option as that could potentially help me prevent these conditions where I can then somehow have a statement that will allow me to use a dictionary and say oh if within the dictionary if Fred has already given a gift then they cannot give again to another person we have this list and so let's try that so let's have some sort of empty dictionary and so and in this Sunday dictionary I want to add all the players and assign them to a an atom to the dictionary so let's go if we can add them into the dictionary so we're putting a list and we want to return a list of couples actually so then we want to package them up into couples what would be the best way to do that let's see if you go from a list to list and you can just cast it as a couple but how would I guess that's worth a shot so you set up going with the dictionary we can take the the list so whatever the list is and then just package it up as a couple so I wouldn't call it my couple and we'll pass it as a couple and once it's Castle randomly so think about this in terms of complex is a real game right obviously this is software so we can cheat a little bit here at certain points but this is an actual game we got a whole bunch of names and a half right theoretically we have that here too it's within the players and then the actual game is you got Barney Walmart's the first person in the circle Barney we just start by emulating that experience players picking names out of a hat let me order Superfluous like I said we can see this isn't a real game and it's it's just software so I mean we have a list of players they're in an order the order just happens to be the order that I typed them in here but can we can we replicate the process of each other right so we still want to be able to iterate through the list of players so for every player in for every player in the list of players you want to be able to choose one of them so let's say we so we're entering through the list of players and we want to I guess a sign each player with another player so so the next thing we need to do that with a randomized name out and get something random we could we could choose we could just have it somehow we could use like a random function like that would select out of the list just a random number with a net list so somehow like somehow make it so that it will pick the first one on the list or the third one in the list I do not remember there's a million mechanisms so I guess kind of going back to my original give us a number and then we could use the the random module the random integer and then select a random number which will be assigned to a different random player within the list so if I'm visualizing this correctly we have five keys in this example of Barney gets a four wheeler gets a one zero just kind of random into within that list and then so now implementing it so you can so from the first to so we first want to get the dictionary and then we also want to attend everything in the players list two dictionary so just do it again baby selected individual now to have that randomly selected individual be assigned to a specific player number now we just need to assign the randomly chosen player to a list solution only choose this if the Eagles so I guess we could do something like where we go within dictionary we could do something like this where we have a specific index numbers can uniquely assign those numeric values to the keys with the dictionary then we know which index in the input list is the pair right I agree with that approach that certainly solves the problem I think that the challenge that I see initially probably should think through next is because if I kind of like a little bit the dictionary and then for each player we're going to appendix there and then you're going to sign that value but what happens if Rand choice prevent that from happening so if Ryan's choice I guess maybe something we would have to okay so from the dictionary.com we pretty much have to ensure uniqueness throughout so I guess so in the first generation but other people as well so if my choice I was chosen so I guess the question then becomes what the I guess I'll have to use the dictionary from the dictionary if it's easier after the random number is chosen what's the weather we can you know is we're entering through the list of players we got two problems first how can we solve for that one or is there an easy way we could solve for that one just by virtue of iterating through the list and knowing what position we're then it should take that out of the available choices so part of it is that would be zero has been given a gift now all right we're ensuring the uniqueness of Point number one by iterating through the list one by one that's and so everybody gives a gift once in terms of 0.005 can get both values and and then if we do that then we can access the players index so if the brand choice is equal to the same index of the players so for example if the first iteration of someone and it will hit this way if 0 is equal to sew in the players and is equal to the first iteration now we should somehow now have skip over Fred for the next iteration Wellness in his first pass right first execution of the loop only one iteration Happening Here in the first value is Fred the index is Zero's into a hat he pulls out zero or in other words I'm going to pick that up I'm glad you know but again so if we're passing on the circle then really each person gets one turn if you will and using Fred as an example without that choice so so if we want him to pick it out again and doing that is essentially here right so but then start time his name is not included in the Box for that use case but let's think about another use case now sure and then you're on the right path here but I think we just need to kind of restructure that the control flow here Fred pulling his name on the first try it's a possibility it's going to happen yeah it's the first index in that from from Ranchos then it's no longer an issue but what if it happens on Wilma at the window just run those two lines of code again believe could be just continuing me but I think that would be the next time that's right let's see so the same add right and then potentially so what I would change here would be simply this so wow that's the case cuz I want to it over the list of players again it's not really necessary in this case is picking the name now we have a name who's not me now I've satisfied points number one because going around Circle points number three because I'm not giving a receiving to yourself which means now we have the second bullet receiving gifts more than once so me just change this here to the logic is the same and so if you're exiting here so let's say Fred shoes at so fresh juices Fred and keep choosing again and once he has chosen someone that's not Fred then we'll have chosen let's say 1:00 and he will how do we determine dictionary that we can get it right over the keys in the dictionary to get a name and the value of each one of those keys is going to be an index how can we ensure as we pick a new name or a new index to sign to a name I can make sure that that name is that index has never been pulled before so you can check the index do something I have to take that number continue working while I'm picking myself or I'm picking somebody who's already picked before right and that's that if statement that you're typing out there how do we determine that somebody has been picked up before the randomly chosen number has is equal to the the the the the key value in the dictionary then that means it has been chosen yeah so just iterate over the dictionary and look to see everything about you before if yes can't receive another gift so that we can't be chosen again yes if they're present in that dictionary because we have selected before as a valid selection and that that should effectively ruled out right so using example so two isn't signed up Freddy have to but we can't give to to Barney again because that index is already been used up that does solve the problem and it's actually completely and I didn't pick somebody who's already picked before that or satisfying the other two constraints of the game and this is happening at random what would happen though if the last name in The List in this case Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam has not given a gift yet but also been hasn't received a gift yet so the only name left in the list is bad bad what's going to happen to this program when you hit that case what would happen if that were the case so bam bam bam bam bam bam I see so then we I guess we should probably put logic in so that it's removed from the list but I feel like that's not the that's such a Brute Force way to prevent that from happening like the way to go but I wouldn't wouldn't remove it from the most right and it's one of those cases where it's not an even or odd thing it's always going to happen additional that way it kind of ensures that bam bam will likely be able to have picked someone that you know he can receive a gift and give it to and the other two can keep going until they're able to get someone that's that way bamboo is included as well that would be my thought process brute force and like I said performance doesn't matter that's not the question right on the rules yeah I think the other way too and this is where the difference of software versus real world comes into play as you can really just cheat and just swap with somebody else right cuz nobody else what questions can I ask for you I would definitely say points of areas of improvement kind of my thought process what would be a better way to approach just general questions such as these I feel like it's difficult to understand to First comprehend the full problem at hand with the constraints into account without fumbling and you know running into education which is like the better way to approach that yeah and I don't say I've this is one that I've retired several years ago because I did it for like 10 years straight but having seen you know 100 people are all over the map in terms of how they approach the problem and it's a hard problem right and the reason I've always on the scale of folks who are very new to getting into programming versus folks who are very mature I've ever seen your level they solve it a very different ways and and me as an interview gives me a lot of insights that I can calibrate against you know for how different folks approach it but I think in general in terms of the feedback there's I think definitely confidence in data structures is an area that I would focus I think this is where I kind of interjected early on is is a bit thinking about the data structure to use to track who's getting what spending have the amount of time on that which is really kind of just stems from that lack of confidence in technical tools right now I'm going to use a for Loop here I'm going to use a dictionary here those kinds of things it does start to become second nature and you start to see a lot of the caveats very quickly the reason I bring up the Bam Bam scenario here at the end which candidates on that part right that's the question because it's an opportunity in every case where you can debug a problem but as long as we get to the answer that was really helpful I think for myself just a small comment is so focused on the the end goal as opposed to the the journey with problems like this I think that's really kind of the challenge is kind of really focusing on not more of the syntax or the tools because I mean like the different data structures and algorithms like they're just you know means to an end right and the actual like you were saying so I think that's great feedback thank you honestly it was very helpful and very definitely a lot of fun for sure a lot definitely push give me the right direction and definitely showing me the logic in a more friendlier way than than necessary sometimes it seems like I was simply pulled the answer which you know not 14 or anything but it seems like it was kind of like being kind of like guided toward which is you know definitely helpful but I guess in hindsight I would say it would definitely be okay to kind of have myself or whoever to struggle a bit more I guess just to kind of go through that you know phase of frustration to get those aha moments that's just be my only two the nursing home in one where I'm kind of undecided on because you know the reason I've developed that habit over the years and just sort of energy people in the right direction is for me it's candidate experience right you want don't want somebody to come away and say like a company suck the interview at the same time like as the interviewer you need something that's going to be challenging and go find the right Talent that's that's that's that's why you get the balance right now I am not in the popular crowd of technical interviewers who prefer the the Whiteboard what would your preference be would it be towards being coached into the end solution and to get through a successful completion whether or not or would you prefer that if we had ended at a point where like you only saw two or three of the bullets we didn't sell everything alright I I even though cuz I think through those moments of frustration even if you're not completing I think I would say having gone through it it seems like the end goal isn't you know isn't the shouldn't be the main focus of the main priority none of this code will be you know for Pride right so it's not like we're going to you know we're trying to make like the most clever algorithm on the spot it's I guess kind of trying to determine you know that's all process and the bigger picture overall so I would say my my my my my opinion would be that even having a more challenging question that forces the interviewer or the interviewing sorry to struggle and to go through those moments of frustration would be more insightful ultimately for the interviewer okay that's why I will thank you I will say Anderson the point very positive aspect that you know one of the things I'm always looking at and a lot of candidates come down to this point is you ask questions or you nudge in certain ways and give feedback in certain ways to see how somebody receives that feedback and nudging and prodding in here was was a bit touching on that and you were very welcoming to that which for anybody no matter how you are on your career that's exactly what you want to see and then Central co-worker is somebody who yeah we can have a conversation and they're not going to get angry at you or something like that when you you suggest one thing or the other you know right righteous and I thought it went really well remember this I have what is a most people are willing to they're already scared of going to an interview and they're definitely not willing to hop on cameras so seriously kudos to Eric for doing this this is phenomenal and you know I feel like I feel like I could almost empathize with Eric I am someone that still gets nervous and interviews and I think a lot of you can advertise as well but you know I think you did a great job working through those problems and you know this is his first interview is really cool to see him grow from this and we even got to have a conversation privately afterwards but I think Eric's going to do very well with his career but let me know in the comments below if you're watching this on video definitely let me know in the comments if you're watching it on audio there's going to be a link to our Discord server you could just hop in and let me know there or how to the video but either way I want to know what you thought of this I'm super curious
