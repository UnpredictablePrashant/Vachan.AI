now we understand that you are a product customer service good morning services and I am basically from north of India but I'm residing in Bangalore south of India from my school days so I have been graduated in Bachelors of Computer Applications from Indian Academy degree College which is also in Bangalore coming to my daily work tasks I log in and I open my emails I check on the requirements or any requests so I interact with the various business or stakeholders stakeholders clients and different managers of my organization to understand the data and the requirement and then I will start my analysis so I have expertise in Sequel I have worked with various joints in Sequel which includes left and I have also worked with various Clauses like we're closed having clothes Group by motorbike laws for filter the data which is required of based on the requirement of the client and I have worked with various aggregate functions in SQL also with the sequel so I have also good knowledge in Excel when I have worked with the we look up at 8:00 p.m. tables are creating charts and graphs so that it is I can communicate the data to the client or the stakeholders on my managers to have a better understanding and Make a Better Business decisions so I also have a very good knowledge in Tableau other visualization from various sources like it can be Excel it can be the CSV format or I

in Python where can I have used a different Library like my network and I'm fine and pandas and whenever I have free time so I I I I I spent time in Reading magazine and I spend time in Reading newspapers and novels a lot of experience everything every day every minute is generated and it is we can information different pieces of data we can gather together and we can make a meaningful information out of it how to define the difference between data and information search data are chunks of details for example if I say if I say a pen it's a data if I say a mobile it's a data and when I say information so that is information never ever use data management concept can you give me a password where they start over the different application tools technique where you start and how will be you know implement this process serving the company is never managed data so I will initiate with Excel so that is a basic thing which everyone can adapt to or understand I will ask them to a like start working on Excel storing the data and then if they are okay then I will approach for equality use amount of data so that is a good option they can have and they can receive data based on they can provide access to people who can access what kind of data or information and then I also will advise them to you for a visualization purpose so that will give more better understanding of the data it will be easy for them to know how the company is performing and where they have to improve so these are the different also advised them to use Python for scientific or mathematical calculations to be done on particular data so yes sir these are my approaches to the company when you approaching this application process and when you were collecting stuff so the attributes what I would consider when it comes to a particular when I am aware of what do I connect for example I want to collect the customer information so I will be using the customer serial number is their names their first name their last name their mobile number addresses and if they are requesting existing customers I would like to know what products they are buying so I have a product column product ID column so these are like customer details what I would consider for customer information because they are for a customer point of view because they are very sensitive and also the bank information correct priority is
