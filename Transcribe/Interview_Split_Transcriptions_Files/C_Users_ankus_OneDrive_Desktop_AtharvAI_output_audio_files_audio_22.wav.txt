okay so hi Rahul welcome to mock interview so I have a 4.045 experience or in manual testing as well as an automation testing so yes before starting so let me use some instructions okay so this video will be recorded and later it will be uploaded in YouTube are you yeah so I can see which is in front of me so you have experience period testing and then I asked some questions you have more experience on automation than manual testing I can see for 5 years almost 3 years of experience in automation okay so I can mainly more focus on automation testing so before starting so can you just tell me about yourself yes my name is Raul and my native place is chapra Bihar I am currently in Bangalore and I have a total of 4.5 years of working experience in software testing field and in my project actually I was responsible for automating detect using Java selenium and in that we are using GitHub for during the test cases and we are using May 14th and building management and we are using Jenkins execution and 0445 requirement changes happen so no managing all 1810 meeting the customer expectation is really challenging task so we we need to design our framework in such a way so that any changes coming future so that we can accept the changes and we can give the you know a quality software to the customer and also sometimes like if there's any communication gap that is a very real because we have very frequent communication in the agile model but sometimes due to like you know not the requirement that time also we get some issue all right so the food documentation process we don't have much documentation parts so we need to travel to get understand requirements so let us say you have a number of test cases on the application so how we will ensure you tested all the scenarios and all applications okay so for that we'll see what is the acceptance criteria for that particular application and going through that acceptance criteria we will see all the test cases we have automated according to the customer expectations and according to the you know acceptance criteria said by the product owner or not and end-to-end functionality are working fine or not all the basic and critical features should be working and whatever the business flow of the software is that should be working fine without any defects and they should not be any Critical Defense then we will say like we have tested sufficiently okay and do you maintain any checklist kind of thing so whether you covered all that test cases or executed all the test cases and do you make any kind of any kind of something like that so currently like oh we do have chocolate will be there like the main functionality will be there addition to be working and also like what are they expectations that you know we want at the end of the workflow of the application should be proper but more or less I will say like you know we discussed all those things in a Sprint planning meeting only and documentation will be there for the you know important and the critical features only functionality will be there in the manual test cases and are disability should be there so we'll follow that okay okay okay okay so while your testing your application a manually so what are the various types of testing you can sew in your project specifically in your project okay so in my project I have conducted functional testing and then integration testing and then system testing and also regression testing okay so what is an integration testing integration testing 150 data flow from the one model to another module like supposed to models are connected with each other so we want if one data is getting created in the first model so this should reflect in the other model so we will verify that and sometimes in you know integration testing the data that is created in the first will be required by the other model to pursue the further testing so this scenario will check in integration testing okay so have you done any performance testing kind of thing in our application status yes yes yes yes or do you follow any techniques yes sir we follow test case design technique for that test will be at 10:00 and we can cover the maximum scenario so in that we follow one even realize she sending different methods that we followed by Design the test cases okay okay okay okay okay okay okay so all right so in your career 4.5 years of experience did you or did you miss any bug or which is again in production it comes and what are the next steps have been taken yeah so it happened like one time I missed one bag actually so in the first project I was new to the organization so that time I have missed a bug and because I was doing manual testing only that time so actually somewhere I cannot recall the exact scenario but it was like something and need to be created in the other model by integration scenario and that was not present so I could not test it that in the other module and so that was you know how many days so we have you know how to fix that bug okay so what is the next reactions have taken so as soon as you found bug on the production so what is the next step you have taken on that bug so as soon as you get back in the production so we need to fix that immediately because you know it will affect the customer business flow so for that we will conduct a meeting and we'll see which one is present in the production and how it is affecting the business flow of the customer and also we will analyze will do the root cause analysis meeting why this bug has come and what is the weather it is in the United States to get together and we'll try to find out the cause of that and we will try to resolve which as soon as possible then you will do the testing of that and then you will again move to the production right so when do you perform regression testing testing we will do once after you know four five build this application main functionality the basic functionality become a stable then we will write education test cases like for automation purpose if I'm talking so I will write the automation test script once the you know application become sustainable then we will do the you know education testing because they will be less feature will be there so that can be tested manually also and button if you become it will also take more time to do the same thing again and again and by the time the software become a table so that time we will start automating the manual of scenario what are comes under the greatest so when you perform the regression testing so what are the things you will be considered so the main thing that will consider while doing the irrigation testing is like a what are the the frequently used functionality like throughout the you know application what are the things that we have frequently doing it manually and those scenario and the critical one the smoke test scenario will first you know like what are the basics scenario cuticles scenario that will first automate and for these some functionality that is newly developed so that is not acceptable some changes may happen that functionality in future so we will not automate those things indication so in the manual testing point of view so what are the things you will consider suppose you have to do something on the bill so before doing the regression testing like what are the test cases to executed during the regulations cycle and what kind of for scenarios or you will test during the testing after when the bill comes we'll do a smoke test scenario electric scenario and then after that we'll see all the critical basic functionalities are working fine then we'll go in depth in the application and then we will start regression testing and you know like the submodel functionality and what are the internal functionality implemented so that we will do first after checking whether the main functionality are working fine then we will go for the regression okay so do you ask anything about the developer is fixed or something so what are the scenarios are impacted because of those pictures or anything about that to the developer sometimes we do have communication regarding that and sometimes because if I'm responsible for a particular model so I will be having knowledge if a dog is getting 15 150 model so which model it might affect okay so best on that knowledge also will find out that so basically when you perform the regression testing first of all you need to know what are the impacted areas what are the bug fixes the developer has done and what are they acted areas so until you know that information you cannot find the relevant test cases to be executed right correct before that even yeah sanity and smoke this is also most important because we should be stable before testing the regression okay yes and do you know what is the difference between change request and feature request as a crescent and a for have you heard about this terms yeah so change the question is like you know change the questionable play relaxation India time and you know I like the other term is like a farm we will if customer is asking whatever requirement he is given so out of the box if he's asking something to do something to implement something so that is coming today for yeah so normally bugs we can call them as a customer change request so if there is any box we need to fix it normally we can call and feature request is nothing but again by the customer so let me ask some questions from java so how much rating can you give yourself on Java from 1 to 10 8:00 okay so just tell me some important features from java which you use in your own automation so that we are using in autumn what time is the first and very important one is inheritance concept we are using so because you know automation framework we are creating a base class and that we are extending in all the other test scripts so there we are you know writing the using test in the basic configuration what are the common frequently performed action on the web page so that we are writing there and also we are using abstraction because we are using you know some reusable methods we have created into the utility package so that we are calling and we are not worried about the implementation of the matter how do you implemented and we are calling that method so I have sex and is there and also in utility package only we have YouTube like for selector if there is a drop down so for like we have implemented by lifting or visible text so that we are using and one important feature of java that we are using in Palm classes in capsulation okay because you know in class we are defining all the element is private and making that class is public and setting better and set a method to use those developments inside our test strip do you use any collections what kind of connections set an alarm in that case we will return elements and if you get window handles then we will get that we are using okay so what is the difference between certain listed in Java especially so main difference between certainly that in list duplicate subjects are allowed and insert duplicates are not allowed the city main difference what is the use of final keyboard so final keyboard can be used with class can we use with variable and also can be used with method so if we are declaring class as a final then we cannot create child class for that you cannot extend that class and if we are declaring a method of final then whatever implementation we have given that is the final implementation we cannot override that and if we are declaring a very well as final then we cannot reassign its value at the time of Declaration of the variable only we have to give it a particular value so what is the difference between final and finally and finally is a block that is used in exception handling so inside finally we write the resource location code that is open at the part of the try block okay okay okay so let me just ask some coding related questions okay so I have two numbers I need to just find out the largest of two numbers and without using this condition so how can you write the code we can share a notepad and you can just write a small piece just use the largest up to numbers and without using this condition play for a long time ago eclipse and if you have Eclipse you can DirecTV okay so I need to take two number and I need to find the largest of the two number and will you give me the numbers and I should not use if it's condition yes okay so that we can do give me one minute timer now if he is not better than me just return B so that is obviously I can recall it now a long time but not you that okay so I can just play some music period and you need to find out how many characters are in uppercase and how many characters are in love with this program and just Define a string variable let's say in the spring you can just throw some welcome to automation something like this and you can just give some of them capital letters some of them are small letters okay so when you need to find out how many are lowercase characters and how many years hey Google hey Google is it done 1 minutes almost done okay so what is your expected result here is I need just find out how many uppercase characters and how many lowercase characters right so you almost have to count the account just modify this program and just check that character is getting you need to put two conditions actually so one is Asian is having all the characters are greater than a and less than Z the uppercase then increase upper upper value see if we can just say if the character is better than smaller and less a small Jet and you can use you can increase the lower price so yeah let me just ask some questions all right so how much rating can you give yourself on selenium especially on the scale of 1 to 10 yeah so I'll get myself 8:00 a.m. tomorrow yes we have viewed implicit wait and explicit weight sometimes also flew into it okay so why use waste statements we use way to statement to you know because selenium is more most of the time faster than the you know like the browser so to do this synchronization between the script so that like if we want to come pick up elements should be visible I should be loaded properly on the web page so for that purpose we use you know synchronization we are using to match the speed of selenium with the webpage so you said like you use some explicit weights in your automation right so when you specify explicit weight you need to have some conditions right so can you just tell me some expected conditions yeah so strict conditions are like the multiple conditions some of that I can and then visibility of element located by presence of element located by all right so this is so what is use of for dessert capabilities desired capabilities is used to not set the required whatever the requirement we have like we want to set the URL we want to set the you know we want to open the window in incognito mode suppose we want to maximize the window so that we can use along with that we can you know we use the respective class and we can make that capability and more mostly the desire capabilities to set the platform and set the mainly we can configure the what type of browser we want to launch and what type of version and what kind of operating system so what is a dog document object model what is a Dom any idea so you mentioned like expired so what is expert and how expensive part of any particular element so in my project we are using Comcast customer service so in the HTML code in HTML okay that is not exactly its statement it's actually a view actually so lower the code they have returned for a web page that will be reflected in HTML when you browsing the page normally what happens is for the same HTML code the Dom structure will be created by the browser itself so expert is basically work based on the notes so the HTML code is the same representation will be there in the Dom structure so document object model we can call it as a document object model so expert is basically Works based on the damn structure sometimes you may seem the kind of exception the element for element not found in the damn something like that yeah yeah because it's basically looking for the elements or looking for that structure okay yeah that's fine and what is the difference between absolute and relative experts socks directly we are going to the particular desire you know no no sorry we are finding the element by just using the double how far is it that will go to that directly you know desired element and in relative expert we are writing it from the rooftop to the desired element in which relative expert you're talking about no in absolute absolute value to directly go to that address and which one is more preferable to use DirecTV if you are using absolute expert so it will be very big so in that case and also it will be faster in execution if you are using you know if you okay so do you see any any shoes with spot any dessert but when you compare with them so in absolute expert disadvantages like I can but I can understand is like I have not encountered any research kind of thing so basically we go for real right now so in between there are so many notes are there so whenever some changes is happening in the webpage right some elements may be added to another place that will automatically impacted the Xbox so if you write an absolute Express from the root note to the current North some even some notice impacted that expert will be automatically broken so that is a problem for us right so it will not be constant and it will not be consistent most of the time so that's the reason we always go with the relative expert what's the meaning so have you used the JavaScript executor yes what is the use of JavaScript University driver dot switch to the window and then we'll keep the window ID so what is the difference between get to window handle and get to window handles get window handle will give you the noises and ID of the parent window and get window handles will give the idea of all the window which is opening so and they return type of get into handles is set of string where the return type of get window handle is string okay that's great so let's say I have a drop down so I have so many options are there so how to find how many number of options are there in the top okay so for that we can you select class method in select class get options method is there to return the list of all the options and then only we can apply size method to get the call okay so how we can do the mouse operations so what are the different methods and glasses are used to perform Mouse operations class and in excess class there are several methods like context click double click move to element and these are the methods that we use dragon season 6 so in the testing is so do you know about how to session yes what is the difference the main difference between hardest and software search if you are using hard as it then if the assassination like whatever the next line is there in the same path that will not get executed and if you are using software then even though validation is failing then the next line get executed and at the end the result will be you know attracted by the in the last will use assert all method so that will give the result of the failure okay so in the testing do you know about the prioritization on the test engine okay so we have so let's say I have a few minutes are giving the priority and some of the methods of not giving so when I execute or not supposed to execute someone else and the first method I have second method one third method again 0 okay so there are two methods which are having 0 priorities and which one will execute first so the two methods that is having 0 priority for that execution will happen but on the you know alphabetical order and for the other one according to the priority that we have defined okay okay suppose first time you have executed let's say you have 100 test cases you have executed all 100 test cases and some of them are got failed some of them are got passed in the second round you want to execute only fail to test cases so how we can execute so for that inside that we will get that we can execute only if you have involved in hybrid even framework so can you just explain about your framework what are the components you created what are the reusable components how things will happen in your framework yeah so you know which is a combination of different camera like data-driven modular driven and Method driven so that are even because we are destroying all the data in a separate folder and we are using no utility classes to read that method in utility package we are creating you know highlighted and executive so using those methods we are reading the data and modular even because we are writing the test cases for particular model and we are storing that in a separate package so that that's why it is a modular even family and Method even because we are you using several no reusable methods and also inside the Palm plus we are creating the usable methods for the common action performance that particular webpage and talking about the components in my framework we have a base class so in base class we are configuring all the you know common sense that we are coming on the browser and play using the configuration notation we are writing those and also we have utility package inside that we have Webdriver utility Java utility absolutely in Webdriver utility we are writing the common methods that that is required for automating the test cases like selector wait for way to load and except a lot of so this methods we are writing inside the driver utility we are initializing those rebellions by using you know any element dot yeah can you tell me that we are using inside the Constructor and we are initializing those web elements and we are declaring that as getting started method we are decaying in that class so that we can access those elements inside our test strip and also we have a defense that we are using as a unit framework you know testing tool and using test engineering scripts and also Tiffany basic configuration that we are using in our Base Class and also we have a resource folder there we are keeping all the driver executable files and we have a screenshot where we are storing all the screenshots of the cases and as we are using one project so there is the one that is the email file we are executing our framework in the Jenkins okay okay okay okay okay okay so and in the hybrid framework so what kind of reports you have used what kind of reported so the HTML reports vacation reports or any reports like something like that anymore so how frequently you run your automation my escapes and we are making sure that every functionality is working fine so how many bucks so far you've found through automation yeah so approximately I have like personally you are asking how many I have found out in the blue automation so while you are executed automation your automation also will find some bugs right yeah yeah yeah some cases for so like approximately 120 bucks that we have found through automation script okay so how many cases are you have automated So Far So yeah so you know in my team there are three members so you know I have automated like around 2:50 p.m. cases in this country not not like personally I have found because you asked about the whole you know personally I have found like 35 bucks around 35 through Automation and as soon as you found box for automation how you will lock those bags how do you report those bugs to the developer so for that we are using jira tool in Girard and then he will be automatically generated and then description do you have any Integrations between your Automation and jira have you skipping okay okay okay that's fine so you said like one you have used in your project so what are the benefits you will get when I use Maven project can you create a maven project so the main benefits of new project is we are using it for Bill creation and Bill testing so that like multiple Engineers are working on the same project so if any modification is done so if that modification is breaking any future then we'll come to know easily within your own project and also in May 1 we are using dependency feature so that you know all the required for that particular project it will automatically download from the Google repository to the local repository and we are using plugins like your favorite and you mentioned like Jenkins or so you have used so what what are the tasks you have done in the Jenkins so Jenkins have created like task and creating the task we have also configured like you know like configuring the Global variable that is required for that particular task and also like the plugins that is required in Jenkins to execute the tasks so that I have done and I have mainly used it for the like executing test cases for drinking to check like whether whatever is script that we have written is working fine or not okay so how Jenkins will get the code so Jenkins that and in the configuration part we will give location of the GitHub location will give there and from the GitHub it will you know constantly monitor location and whenever this is coming then when we are starting the execution for Jenkins it will download that file from the guitar and then it will do the execution okay that's fine so how frequently you check in your code in GitHub on daily basis or weekly basis and how frequently check in your court so Lake we are taking it almost on the daily basis at the end of the day whatever Court we have eaten so and yeah infinite review is need to be done like if any other details so they like we will review them then we will merge it so we are taking it on a daily basis do you know any basic commands like comments for OK Google tester automation tester so whatever you know that is fine to manage but you need to learn a few more like a logical related programs that will be okay and the largest questions but programmatically you need to improve a lot you need to adjust some logical related program so that will improve your skill set and from selenium also and whatever questions I asked most of them you have answered correctly and yeah so almost you have 4.55 thank you very much
