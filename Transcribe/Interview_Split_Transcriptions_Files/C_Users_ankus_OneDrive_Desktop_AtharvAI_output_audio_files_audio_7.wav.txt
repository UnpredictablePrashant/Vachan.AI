in this video I have invited nitish Kumar who is inspiring data analyst basically a fresher who is looking out for a job in the power bi rule is the potential pressure and you will see in the future he will definitely secure a job in this video I will be taking his power away interview and I hope he performs very well so let's start the video and before that if you need to the channel then do subscribe it and hit the Bell icon to stay updated with all the coming useful videos you can follow me on Instagram learn with gigs where you will get regular job related updates as well it's short videos on its domain and friends do hit the like button of this video because you're one like will give me the motivation to create more videos like this now let's head towards the internet so my name is nothing I am 2023 graduate I have skills in power bi sequel Python and Excel I have worked up on several personal projects in which I have utilized these tools to solve real-world problems while working on this project I have worked upon data extraction data cleaning data modeling data analysis and data visualization part so like how many projects and in Python I have done one project on Spotify okay let's start with the first question so suppose you have three tables okay in power query and the structure of all those three tables are like similar to each other now you went ahead and upended those three tables okay but okay so you have upended now now if you want to do the clothes and apply so what will happen all those three initials plus that appendage of all those three tables will be loaded in power bi right yes but I don't want those three tables to be loaded I only want that appendix table to be loaded in power bi how will you manage this so in power query we have an option to we have option to enable road then from there we have to check that and then we will close and apply then only that particular queries do you know when when do we use have you used index column yes I am using text column what kind of scenario do we use index in my in my case my table was not having a primary key and I wanted to establish a relationship between the between two tables period and then I will check on column quality or column profile then from then from that we will be able to get a summary of our prayer column where we will be able to see how many distinct value of a column is containing and how many total values our colon is having if suppose that column contains around 20000 records OK Google yes can you tell me what is basically it's a similar to join in Sequel so suppose we want to we want to create a master table based upon based upon some other table then in that case we want to join two tables so by using a common column between both the tables we can join we can create that master table so much we have left what is left in the world from left table is not present in the right table so how do you differentiate how do you differentiate that when we see when like in general in fact table there are there are more number of data presents like there are more number of rows patients and if we see that there are some columns which are which are repeating in the table then in that case we will consider that table is a fact table but what happens in a dimensions are not represented means we will be getting the data testing Google this is and and Festival will be continuing the quantitative data and diamond WWE containing the quality of vitamins Dimension table will be having information about any particular Dimension can you explain what is a snowflake schema reduce the data redundancy okay what is cardinality cardinality means the theaters cardinality represents the relationship between two tables like how these two tables are related so this can be one to one minute to many so ideally what kind of cardinality we should prefer one too many relationships turn off slices wild in the donut chart we have the information present in the form of arts and in the Donut chat there is a hole in between and in pie chart there is no hole in between so basically the Donut chat is just a variation of a pie chart means upon requirements like what kind of visuals will be suited for our report visualization how can you differentiate a measure with a calculator and it will not be taking any extra amount of calculated what is a page level filter base level three and if you go to any other place will not be affected by this filter have you set up yes how do we how do we do that firstly Ford filter we must have a hierarchy of data like if you want to enable drill through for some great column then we must have a hierarchy of year then month and and then date and when we drag and drop that thing on our visual then that will be automatically enabled our and there is a fork like icon and if you click on that phone like I can then we will be able to do you know how to do how to set up a customer service on any particular visual for which we want to we want that to visual so we have to link that tooltip to that particular visual then if the hover over that visual then we will be able to see that in our business period I want to see the total sales of country India for example of country India should be visible okay so how do you create a measure for that I think I have to use so you are telling our power report we have to use calculate calculate function then inside the caliper function as a filter modifier we have to we have to pass the country name is India there okay now the next part is if we also have a country slicer yes so 544 how do the iterator functions work like the functions which ends with X how do you work so it basically goes Rose by Rose and then then apply the condition which we have written inside the theater function and then according to that it gets the it gives the scalar value for each group what does filter function returns a subset of our tablet tablet is there any difference between last year I do not think like I do not think there is any difference between these two phones because if so what kind of license as a developer you should have to do this we should have a license because it is it will it will be economically economically viable for that company to get to use that so if I say that nothing like I just said I can say to you that organization you have a blue license you will say yes right yes if I say to you do you have a premium license so is that right there is a difference between Pro license and premium license suppose if you ask me that you have a pro license then I will say yes but when you asked me when you say to me or do you have a premium license then in that case I will say know why because premium license is is to an organization other than any individual person so what organizations to that it's usually okay do you know about this so what can you do as a developer I can I can publish the report and I can assign a member I can assign a new user which will be having access level lower than OK Google weather in Mumbai and our awesome team which works on sale and we want that team to just see the data about cells so in that case we will be using the whole level security to show that team just the data options and enrollable security there are two types like one is a static and one is dynamic so in a static we each time we want to assign an accessible to any particular user then we have to do it but what is that we give the filter or email address to the table to the table to and then when we want to give the access then into Power service we just entered the email ID of that person then that person will be able to get the access according to his shoes okay what is a data Gateway do you remember yes so so much OK Google turn on more than 95% of the questions you said the right answer obviously from the power be a service side you don't have much exposure so we can expect that thing but other than that you have a good knowledge and you are really doing good so all the best because whatever you are doing just keep doing that and I think in the coming time you will definitely get a job as a fresher thanks for your business
