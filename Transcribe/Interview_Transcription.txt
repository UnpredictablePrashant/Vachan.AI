okay I miss you so very much how about you yes I'm also doing great thank you I have seen your profile so it seems to be very feasible for the current position and I wish it would be great if you can walk me through five listen to to get give the meaningful information to the heart dataset so any of the projects you are associated with English so I was associated with one of the project where we used to find out the export data for one of the photos Facebook where I have to find the insights about the export of coffee from India to European countries so we have a list of 10 to 15 companies which we have to find out okay what are their profit margins and what are there was the selling price is about the about that particular product period they are lacking and what are the countries that they should Target about from Europe where they can have a good profit margin from they can get a good Revenue out of it so this was my project in the last 20 years or so in the company great so all right so what's your business full stop if you can give me a task and you give me a deadline I'm ready to give me that deadlines so I'm very hardworking person third is I am open to any kind of Learning Center so if you are giving me a new opportunity in any of the technology which I am not having a good knowledge of so I'm hoping to learn that technology in a specified time so that I can improve and grow as per the company States so let's jump into the question tell me how do you handle missing days in order to find missing value of missing volume settings so first of all we have to go to the particular source of providing the data so as to find out okay please tell me what is this message something which has been missed if you can Rectify it then it is fine other than that we have some of the tools that are used in power bi as well as in Python where we use some of the functions to fill that missing values like in Python we use backflow of forward we use mean Max mode whatever the particular set of or whatever the business account as per the business requirements we feel those missing backwards so it's a part of our particular database according to the business need and as per after speaking to our manager or the data Provider from The Source from which state is coming after a discussion with them we particularly handle accordingly so on a scale of 108 so what states are I would rate around 8:45 8815 so let's get started today and how can you create one so sorry do you have any understanding what are indexes indexes are used to retrieve the data in a secret in a very much faster than two types of indexes like a cluster index in Augustus cluster index what's the date and a sequential order like if you have to retrieve faster we use cluster in text where is cluster index whenever we Define a primary key in a table the cluster index automatically it gets injected whereas in non-clustered index it's not the primary key is the unique who is a which is the differentiator over there so as I told that cluster and non-clustered in Texas okay so how they improve query performance okay because it is sorted okay so it's very easy because if you talk about non Plus in the case of our books so we have indexes suppose we have to read some of the chapter in that particular book we go go to the next part we see which page number this particular chapter is and then we go to that particular page number and read that chapter okay likewise is in the sequel as well suppose I have to retrieve the data from let's say let's say it's a employee ID 3D data and select everything from employee table where the employee ID is equal to 3 so this is the part of index say okay so that is the record which I want to fetch and that is possible with the help of index so how do you use a case statement in sequence statements if I have to find some of the requirements or I can say some cases are there suppose I want to find those records where the salary range is between 20,000 to 50000 those persons report so in that case we can use case statement as well or some some way to filter the data in order to fetch the date can you please provide me some example of using case for conditioning logic in star from Obama is when Saturday is greater than 50,000 then give that employee then name that particular column as employees with salary greater than 50,000 of the create another attribute in particular sequel record so as to just segregate the details with the help of cases coming to the next question Define me what do you understand by the term or the concept what is the concept of normalization and sous vide do we do a create a partitioning of the table of we create that particular table into a subset of tables okay so that process is called normalization and what about denomination again from just the reverse of normalization is a reverse of normalization sure I'm not pretty sure it's a temporary use in a particular query in the particular scenario and it's just it's just an alternative to use a Subway Surf City we create a temporary table and with we can reuse that particular table in our particular car in that area as well multiple times so this is called cities so that's the end from SQL so how would you rate yourself on a scale of 10 for power 7777 tell me the difference between dietary so important and added the two main motivational from the sources import mode we are completely and taking the date that means data from particular sources we are just injecting the whole table into a particular power bi desktop where is we in the direct query where establishing a connection between a power bi and a particular source that is equal to or any of the source postgame is equal in the database so these these this is a major difference between a important directions most of the visualization tools are applicable in the import mode which are not applicable in the DirecTV remote okay and it's easy to use it's easy because the query performance is also very high in the in the import mode where is the query performance is low in the directory mode Dax expression doesn't work in the direct query mode and most of the some of the visuals doesn't work doesn't support very much so let's say that you have to create and use for calculated columns and measures in baby so how are you going to do that so calculated columns are used when the when we have to evaluate a calculation in that case and it is also known as row context where is if your evaluate if you are getting the aggregate evaluation of the data then in that case we are using matches and it is ya suppose if you if I have to calculate revenue and that Revenue would be calculated aggregating in that case I would be using message suppose now I have to calculate the price of any commodity or of any product and then in that particular table I have a unit price of that particular commodity and as well as I have to quantity of that particular commodity so in that case we cannot use measures we have to use because he will have the means different unit price and the and the quantity sold so in that case we would be using calculated columns where is if you have to sum of the whole particular quantity sold or if you have to some of the whole price of the particular products then we can use measures so have you come across tax yes so how do you implement time intelligence in power bi using that so sorry for the functions that that we use as a Time intelligence period so tell me the key components of a power bill reporters and the tables cancel cancel so tell me how do you add power be reports and dashboard with others so sorry my understanding have not shared the report because I'm not given the opportunity to share with you period in terms of 10 so I would rate around 6:00 in 5668 so let's get started okay so my first question is how would you use Python to automate data extraction from various apis and combine the data for analysis and with the help of some of the functions like we can use to to merge the data into the particular settings so last question explain how would you use Python to detect and handle and only in a data set what are the techniques and libraries would you employ python for example if you have a data set so first and foremost thing is to find the missing value and then we have to find that the data is having a proper Integrity or Not by having the proper sense of details so we handle the missing value we followed the function like we see so that we can find that data isn't proper structure so these are the steps that we use in Python to work with some other team okay how soon you can grab stuff you know new technology so if I have given a chance to work with you so sorry give me the chance to learn any of the new tools so how soon you can get I can be ready in around 14 to 20 days max volume where do you see yourself in the next 5 years I want to grow into the systems of first of all the present company only I want to be to a topmost position with new learnings so that I can help others as well if I mean going to newcomers in the industry so in that in order to help you have to gain more and more knowledge and I want to be on that position and and how can manage it from the person like that I mean how can you do that in spite of having multiple projects and Target lines so what do you see nothing but how you systematically maintain your voice so whatever the task has been given to you on a daily basis on an hourly basis in an organization you have to maintain that particular you have to complete that task in particular deadline is because they are dealing with us they are just keep on piling up their work and that is where they are lagging if you're maintaining that work if you are stuck somewhere else Wells Fargo with that ambition thank you for joining today's podcast so we'll get back to you with the feedback again okay have a great day and all the very best thank you

hello hello good morning yes tell me something about yourself so first of all thank you so much for giving me this opportunity so my name is and I am from Pune and I've completed my Bachelor's in Business Administration and international business coming to my hobbies like to play guitar for sale so now we are doing the mock interview okay so tell me what is the primary key the primary key is a key that is a unique key which can only be one in a table and it cannot be a null value good can we put more than one primary key in a table know that can only be one primary care okay is it possible to drop primary key yes we can okay so do you have command about what is the foreign key is used to combine tables can be more than one and it can accept is it possible to delete data from parent table if the data is existing in childhood no we can't get an error okay so anything else if you want to delete the data from parent table that is the existing in childhood yes we can delete the data for sleep from the child table then it is possible to delete the data from the primary table okay good you have mentioned the joints do you have do you have practice on that joints okay so just tell me about the joints first okay okay do you have the cross what is the internet how many values from the left and it will include all the values from right okay what about right outside the values from the right table common values from right table and it will include all the values from left table as well okay so can we say the laptop charger everything from left and coming from right okay and what about full outage okay okay is it possible to join do joints in a 3152 view a table multiple which can be Select Staff from table name where the salary is in range of 50,000 and 60,000 instead of writing this in an entire way such a long code I can just put it inside of you and I can just call that you by saying select star from the view that I have just created so that will make things more easy and faster okay is it possible is it the table and view is having same road ID know they have different okay do you have the material OK Google according to you just correct me the table and metalize you is having same different Road ID is it take MetLife view physical space yes it will take physical space is it possible DML in Naturalizer okay no problem turn off view what is the Google Ok Google what is the size that is used as a reference today's date as a reference in the data okay so can you tell me the aggregate functions okay what is the command of the total salary in a table so we can do that some of celery and the command select star from sum of salary you should aware about that okay no problem so what is the difference between where and having a few differences so having can be used only with Group by the group by where is where it can be used anywhere and having we need to use aggregate functions along with having whereas in case of faster because it faces data specifically using aggregate functions is not that faster good what is the difference between delete we can delete only specific rules trunk it will delete everything okay delete 12 / delete we can delete the all records okay which one is faster drunk it is faster okay okay everything is okay so so we are giving to some questions just try to solve on your laptop okay how to find second maximum salary in a tablet just show me okay good so just show me you have mentioned some table just display that table I need it to fix the speaker can we fix the maximum salary in a group yes just right just writing that I guess you needed to find out the maximum salary in a group right now so whatever maximum salary I want to display the maximum salary you what what is my knowledge level so where do you think I should increase my knowledge or if there are any specific pointers which will help me to get good skills to be acquired in your company okay the most important thing your confidence is good that is the most I guess you are doing the first time the mock interview and you belong to no on it and everything is okay somewhere you like somewhere because of the practice and in here whatever we have given you got it and you are doing so do more practice and whenever you can shut it down and do the practice in front of the mirror mirror and some people are there in front of you and again try to keep interviews and check it you will become come as soon as because the shortly you can reach their the next time whenever you do a video interviews can we come to more complex questions okay so all the best

all right so this is a mock interview with Rishi popteenie Rishi has close to 10 years of experience working in the capital markets domain as a programmer analyst and as a business analyst and the purpose of our conversation today is to get to know reshy a little bit better and to understand some of the experiences that he's had as a business analyst so with that said welcome Rishi to the mock interview thank you thank you very much all right so I wish you would like to do is kind of I've had a chance to go through your resume and I see that you do have quite a bit of experience in the domain that is being interviewed for what I like for us to do is to really just kind of get to know each other a little bit and then we'll just dive into the the contents of your real estate a little bit more so I'm wondering if we can start that off with you just play me a little bit about yourself so as you pointed out I have over 9 years of experience as a business analyst most of it has been in the Capital Market space in my most recent project I was working with one of the leading investment banks in Europe and I was part of that I bought implementation I was the lead business analyst for a software that was responsible for the submission of interest rate benchmarks on a daily basis so the bank that I was working for is on the panel that makes regular submissions to Benchmark administrators and that's why this the software is not only critical from a functional or an operational perspective it has reputational risks associated with it as well as absolutely so that seems like that's seems like very it seems like one of those types of projects where there's a lot of pressure to make sure they're not any major mistakes especially with reputational risk we'll get into your experiences as a as a lead business analyst a little bit a little bit later on so that's a that's a great interview that's a great first answer to that question can you kind of just give me a little bit of an overview of the throughout all of the projects that you've been through you know there are certain types of projects where you can be on where things tend to go very smoothly and undoubtedly if you're involved in any kind of IT project you're always going to be involved in a project where things don't go as smoothly for your own experience is have you had any situations where things haven't gone as smoothly and can you talk a little bit about some of the things that you did in that project yes the way I look at it I am only able to make a living because things don't go smoothly because if they did I mostly people like me wouldn't be required I don't mean to be a firefighter but what I'm trying to say is what kind of work that business analysts do is fraught with ambiguity right so and the risk is even more when the when the project deal with a really important things like I bought submission or the implementation of a major regulatory platform like message to sew on a on a regular basis I'm faced with typical issues that business analyst face for example difficult or recalcitrant stakeholders people I would just take holders who are not clear exactly on what they want they know why they're doing something in some cases not even that but mostly I've been lucky enough to work with stakeholders who got the business drivers sorted out but they it becomes very difficult for them to prioritize their needs so that's frequent Challenge and those deck keep moving up and down right so that's something I have to deal with secondly being at the Crux of the development process a software development process I have to deal with development teams with QA professionals deployment professionals devops guys and all of these guys have their own timelines their own agendas and in a lot of cases their own motivations so to balance all of these right that is something that is common that that's something I've experienced in all my projects so I would say that these two are I would say yeah these two other the biggest challenges that in general have faced in my career yeah that's actually great because that answer kind of really your experience really shows through in that answer because what I'm hearing there is that you what's the experiences where you're dealing with a lot of stakeholders who are not totally clear about their own needs first of all you'll have oftentimes stakeholders and organizations where you'll have the stakeholders that you have on your own project or going to have competing needs you'll experience those types of situations on a lot of projects and what I've also noticed in what you're saying here is that you actually have full life cycles implementation experience because if you're working with the devops teams for example that typically means that you are working to move things from one and to another and so you're not just doing the up front business analysis work you're actually working full life cycle lacrosse the entire development life cycle and delivery process which is which is very good just like cycling back to the idea of working with stakeholders who have let's say very unclear needs do you can you talk to us a little bit about you're approaches to dealing with a stakeholder who is when you're dealing with much more seniors stakeholders who are at the Strategic level a lot of times they have a good sense of the direction that they want the organization to go in and they understand their own business needs at a high level can you talk to us a little bit about what you do with stakeholders like that to help them understand what their more detailed requirements might be and to help them kind of clarify their own understanding of what it is that they need operationally what happens with family senior people is that as you said they know of very vaguely what they want but they're not quite sure how to go about and in some cases they might have a set of priorities that's right I used successfully in the past are there is a set of prioritization techniques so there is something called the hundred dollar technique so hypothetically speak to them first list out say the top five or six things that you want to do brainstorm I will not count a question anything that you say let's just write down whatever you whatever comes out of your mouth and then if I give you $100 right now and ask you to spend it on just the top four out of these five or six what would be the amount that you would allocate each of those four and which ones would you leave out that sort of gives me an idea of what what they are subconsciously prioritizing but not able to probably get through immediately that's one second is we use something called Quality Function deployment it's something that is very time-consuming and that's why it's used only when your traditional approach is don't don't have so things like let's do what's benefit analysis so if you do something what is the benefit that you are going to get versus what is the risk of the loss that you face if you don't do it right so a combination of these two things often helps us to prioritize if to take it further what we what I often do is get some technical Personnel involved and add to this makes the level of technical risk involved so feasibility with respect to resources that are available that's also important which helps us sort of get a very good handle on what needs to be tackled first yeah and I think that's a very it's a very effective prioritization technique that you use to basically give somebody a certain amount of credit and say you know what what things do you really want because when you force a person to really have to allocate those Victorian you know credits then you really get force them to kind of think that think through their own what is in a in a very in a very clear way which is which is very good now let's imagine a scenario where we have let's say two director-level stakeholders on your project and you're really spearheading the scoping of the project and you're doing the business requirements and now these two directors have a very different priorities of what they want from you and let's say we have an example where there's one director who is really looking for a certain feature in the product that you're looking to deliver but another one of our directors who is on the same project has a very strong objections to expanding the resources needed to deliver that product to deliver that feature in the product and they are really trying to get their own items on to the list ahead of the priority if you're faced with the situation like that what are some of the things that you can do to help resolve that situation yeah so I faced a similar situation not not exactly the same because frankly I've never had the fortune slash Misfortune of dealing with two directors at the same time but yeah pretty Senior People representing competing into groups so there was just on my last project where are on the eyeball implementation there are two groups that are constantly loggerheads because of the nature of the work that they're supposed to do one is the group that is responsible for getting the submissions out on time the second is our internal surveillance group who will do anything to slow things down so as to minimize the risk of erroneous submissions now you can probably imagine why these two guys are all these two groups are always at Cross purposes right so there was a feature where the submission team had wanted a copy from yesterday feature so figures that was submitted yesterday could be submitted and he was he was really adamant that we should have it but the when this when these features were taken to the surveillance group for the validation they were up in arms they didn't want this they said that if the team is getting paid every day they should be using their brains every day to come up with numbers the software is helping them to do that copy from yesterday is not a good future for several reasons so obviously arbitration is the first approach I tried to get them on the same table and speak about it but when he became clear that there was not going to work and I don't clean the credit for this one of my report is suggested this we support the idea and we put it to both parties the idea was that the submission team would be able to copy from yesterday but they would be able to do that only a certain number of times a week and and the number of times that they will be able to do that during the week would be controlled by the surveillance team depending on the depending on the periods of stress for the bank and so in that experience that you find that both of the parties were I don't want to say happy but where they both willing to go along with with that suggestion yes and they actually want to my support in it and I was really happy that both parties got something out of it not exactly what they wanted but yeah that was one recent example of how we dealt with competing requirements that's excellent and it's good to hear that you have stakeholder groups negotiating in the way that you in that case because oftentimes you'll find that when there are those types of competing priorities a lot of times the two sides can't come together and they can't really agree on a solution that's as Innovative as as the one that your team delivered so that's it's great now let's just imagine the center that same scenario but let's say we didn't have that Innovative Solution on the table and we just really couldn't get the two teams to agree would there be another approach in your mind and handling that situation if that hadn't worked I had only one thing in mind I was going to escalate this to my manager and ask him to arbitrate because he was more likely to be listened to and this might seem like a vanilla solution but to be honest thing that I could have thought of was in in our project right it's all revenue driven so sometimes simple question of who's paying for the future right so if someone is paying for the future and they're ready to have it delivered and it's it's the burden of not executing the future due to sort of an audit Step Falls on the surveillance team then I would tell them look take it up with the other team or your superiors if he produces feature and then later then at least it's not in our bucket yeah yeah that's good and I think that the last option to escalate is always the option that we have to fall back on a lot of times as business analyst when we've tried everything else you've tried all the Innovative approaches that you can take and you're still saying that you're stakeholders are really not able to come to some sort of an agreement then it seems like a lot of times those escalation paths need to exist in the organization and your ability to escalate through your own chain of management as usually the right way to to get those things results that's so that's great I want to touch a little bit on your experience in working with the development and the infrastructure teams in across the different projects that you've been on so software developers tend to have a very unique I would say a disposition and they tend to have their own way of working and in most organizations that's the case but in projects where you're really developing or you're enhancing these Michelle Mission critical systems like the ones that you've had experience working that have massive reputational liabilities possibly attached to them in those types of situations the developers tend to have very very high standards and they have tend to have very high expectations of the analysts that they work with and so can you speak a little bit to your experiences with that yes I would say that I've been lucky we have to work with some really good developers and because they're very good at what they do they expect the same level of competence from everyone around them that is generally been the case but if I had to pick one situation it was my method to implementation right now that was a very high pressure regulatory program that had a hard stop because the regulation went live on the 3rd of January 2018 so there was no sort of negotiation we had to get it done there was a piece on instrument data determination which was really complex and the developers were they they had they had no idea of the complexity but they were they worked very closely with me to to identify what exactly needed to be done it was sort of a symbiotic process because I needed to understand the feasibility of what what I was going to propose so I worked very closely with them and there was a there was a very closed feedback loop all the time so go back to the to the requirement owners take the requirements from them give to the developers check doable check feasible Etc if and and because of this we managed to to implement or deliver a very crucial piece of functionality whereby the developers also found a part of the solution so they were not just writing code but they felt like equally vested stakeholders right from the beginning because their voice was heard very often I've seen projects where even when in some of my ears where I was working with senior beers and they would treat two ways or development professional as separate teams and sort of develop silos in their own heads but I have to avoid that and I've seen that it really helps okay good that's good because those like you said in many organizations some business analysts will oftentimes just treat them as a separate team not really doing a whole lot of consultation as their determining the business needs and writing their functional specifications and they will sometimes only consult the development team right at the back end when they think they have everything ready and not getting that development feedback right up front with a lot of what you're producing can oftentimes create problems for you down the line that you're not going to be able to see so making sure that the development team is looped in all throughout especially for very complex things where a lot of times the development teams themselves will have a lot of questions that the analysts might not necessarily have thought of so having that regular interaction with them and making them feel like they've been heard that they're concerns have been heard is very important for developers especially in this domain so just looking at your resume here so it seems here that you have a bit of a programming background as well so you started off your career initially as a programmer analyst yeah that's right okay and so you would you say that in the domain that you're in that your development background helps you in in some ways or do you think that that's something that's that's just coincidental I would say it's a very important thing it's a it's a great asset two ways so when is first two things I wanted to be in the industry but not in this world I saw that I'm most suited to that so it helped me in my choice of career so that's their of course and having written code for a bit and I still write code in some forms so sequel a bit of python so that helps me understand how they think of problems and solutions so in terms of data structures right in terms of how data would be transmitted stored viewed what could be the Practical difficulties with something that I am proposing so I can't just say you know what is the requirement to go do it it's not my problem so yeah it does help me because I've been on the other side for a bit okay that's great going back to your experiences as a team lead now let's say if we were in the process of launching a new project that we estimated we need five total analysts for and it was in an area that you have strong domain knowledge in in that situation do you think that really not really knowing anything about any of the other endless that are on your team would you see yourself more as a team member initiative like that or would you see yourself as more of a team what is the official position so it could be that the four other the five other analysts are working with me are equally experienced and are equally talented and there is no clear demarcation as to who's going to report to home that's one way of looking at it secondly pieces of work that will be that we are assigned individually obviously at some point we would sit around the table and and share what we're going to do and how to do it share each other's piece of work if it became clear that those pieces are pretty independent and can be analyzed independently completely I insulated from the others then the question of leading as such Doesn't Really arise but if it seems that there's a lot of synergy between the points and bye just consultation really has the knowledge to Fast Track this then I'd be more than happy to follow or lead as the case may be okay okay if I was to rephrase that question let's say in a slightly different way let's let's imagine that we're in the Inception phase of the project where we're still trying to get an idea of what the scope of the project is would you be comfortable in a setting where it is your responsibility to scope out the project and to have another analyst or another two analysts let's say that would be reporting to you where they would be more responsible for doing the details specifications when the time comes so during the Inception phase of the project typically what you're doing is you're just having them kind of tag along with you to listen to the conversations knowing that the ramping up that you're doing of these of these other analysts on your team possibly that you're going to need them to produce a lot of the details specifications with the with the knowledge that they've gained in in doing the Inception with you would you be comfortable in an environment like that are there some things that you can tell us that you think would help you carry out a role like that yes so of course I would be comfortable because I've done that before and what would help me right off the bat is to get the scooping done as quickly as possible because I realize that the school wants decided is never supposed to change but almost always changes so use your contacts diagrams use your feature list and whatever it is that you have to do I would get the scope done first and then it really fast share it with the team with the two people who are going to be speaking it out in in Greater detail and once I know once I get feedback from them how how easy how difficult it is to speak it out to flush the details out to actually get functional testable requirements and then I think I would use that feedback to refine the scope further so sometimes it is this is happened to me before where the scope as is got from a customer sort of start creeping on its own when it's detailed or okay so you'd be happy having two or three or one or two analysts tag along with you in these coping sessions to to help them along and really part of the trouble that you may run into in this situation is that you may have some analysts that who are possibly trying to get into too much detail too quickly play and we would stakeholders you often want to make sure that you're carrying out the right level of conversations with the right people and sometimes you may have to make sure that your analysts that are on your team are not kind of pulling the conversation in the wrong in the wrong direction or two level of detail too quickly as well that's good I think those are all of the questions that that I had with you I want to thank you for attending this interview and is there anything else that you would like to add before we conclude no it was great and I think it's it's fantastic for someone who wants to get into the field and has no idea about what to do so it's great and I appreciate this chance to speak to you so thank you for your time that's good and this was excellent by the way

I'm very excited to be doing this candidate Showcase with Simon wild today and this is because Simon is a very experienced professional with more than 20 years of experience in the IT industry working mostly as a business analyst a business analyst leader and everything in between Simon has extensive experience working in the public sector working in the financial services industry and in utilities so let's welcome Simon Simon welcome to the candidate showcase interview I'm wondering if we can just get started off with you telling us a little bit about yourself hi good morning now thanks thanks for doing this in Canada and the UK for 1:20 a.m. to retail stock brokers in the UK and moved from there to Professional Services freelance for a few years and move to Canada and I've been working essentially in the financial services from predominantly the fun space for the last 10 years all right excellent excellent now looking at your profile here I can see that you have an extensive amount of experience in industry and that's a professional who has that kind of experience you're inevitably going to be running into a lot of different ways of delivering software and so agile as we know is one way of delivering software waterfall is another one I'm wondering if you can speak to us a little bit about your experiences in trying to implement agile in the organizations that you've worked in sure so implementing agile I think it's really dependent on the The Experience the team that you're working with one organization I worked in agile was kind of seen as a euphemism for being a cowboy and so try to steer away from using certain terminology to try and focus more on the benefits and efficiencies and getting value out and helping people understand that so a lot of it in terms of implementing agile has been about the communication part making sure people are aware of the benefits I think that's true about implementing anything even if it's a new piece of software so different approach really trying to make sure that people are aware of with trying to keep the communication lines open making sure everyone's involved everyone's aware and what's the benefit of getting a minimal value proposition out as soon as possible what's the minimum viable product you know how can we get something out to you as value as soon as possible so that you're going to see the benefits of this straight away and then you can build on that and really kind of installing the benefits of doing that kind of minimum implementation and then building on it now I mentioned combating the The View that it's being agile can be seen as being a bit of a cowboy Behavior what I mean by that is it can have a perception that you're trying to do something just quick without any care just get something out there as quick as possible my personal View and experience is that you can put as much rigor into agile as you can in any other methodology and it's really just down to how you structure and work out what the bounds are and what the actual needs of the organization are for example if there's documentation means meets agile doesn't mean you don't document anything play common misconception I'm glad to hear you say that yes yes in a different way that's right or use a different structure for example traditional business requirement documents may have long paragraphs of text one of the things that I like to do is to break that down into finite points using a user story structure do you really make it finally something that you know is easy to understand for both the stakeholders the developers something that's quantifiable for the q18 is well and it also lends itself to to uploading into things like jira team Foundation server so you have that traceability of things as well yeah and I'm so glad to hear you say so many things that you've said because much of the perception about going agile I think in the industry maybe a little bit off of what practitioners see on the ground and how many liters many it leaders even in Industry tend to have a very overly optimistic perception of what agile can do for them or they tend to have the idea that agile is going to get them to do a lot more work in a shorter period of time I like the fact that you emphasize on the fact that the idea here is for us to get a minimum viable product out as soon as possible which is really the main purpose of going agile and I think it's to your experience is in Industry to know the fact that in many organizations agile can sometimes just be code for doing a chaotic way of doing an implementation very unorganized and so a lot of people will put the agile label on that and it's good to see that you have the awareness as an IT practitioner and as a leader you have the awareness that these are some of the major pitfalls of going agile so that's that's very great to see I see also here on your profile that you have experienced establishing a ba Center of Excellence which I think is a very large and beneficial thing that can help organizations in a big way I'm wondering if you can speak to us about some of your experiences is in taking that on sure I mean essentially I would say that one of the reasons that drove me to to do that was that the organization was working in it at the time when I joined had no understanding of what a business analysis team can do and so part of it was about building awareness of what is professionals are able to do and offer you know how can we get that to the team right and getting it out in a way that people could access it and see what was going on so part of it was about increasing the visibility of the team part of it was about increasing the capability of the team part of it was about putting in processes and procedures and I want to say putting in processes and procedures it's not a case of here's a template you must fill out section A B and C in this way it's more a case of here's a suite of tools that we have in our toolkit that could be used in different circumstances is it appropriate to use this type of uml diagram for example is it more appropriate to do a slide deck who's the audience and putting in place things like regular weekly sessions for continuous development together we would get around a table we would discuss a point or they'll be a particular learning so getting a number of different things in place to help really strengthen the capability of the team and make sure that we're constantly building that so one example would be putting together a business requirements document as I've mentioned before I like to use user stories within them say hey look here's an example could this be applied to your projects and the other part of it as well that I have mentioned is ongoing coaching so once one sessions with individual basis if they needed specific help on a specific project or a specific tool really try and help homeless skills and make sure they have a stronger set of tools in their toolkit yeah and what I really like about your approach to establishing this Center of Excellence is the fact that you're not really just applying a templated version of processes and procedures what you really encouraging your team your business analysis team to do it seems like as part of this initiative is to understand that they have a set of tools available to them but not all tools are appropriate for types of challenges and as part of being an analyst especially when you start to get into the intermediate and senior level is really having a clear understanding of what tools are appropriate for what situation so I really like the fact that you take that approach where you're making a tool set available to them and really leaving it up to the analysts and guiding them through trying to determine what tools are the right fit for what situation so that's a that's a very important point there can you maybe give us a little bit more insights around the challenges that come with having to Mentor more junior members of a team or having team members who you know a lot of times when you have different people on your team you have analysts that will have be at different levels of seniority they will be at different capability levels can you maybe just talk to us a little bit about some of the challenges of doing that type of mentorship with your team members sure I mean I would say that mentoring my Approach is more around coaching and one of the first things that can be challenges if you're working with someone as a coach they need to be coachable they need to be open to the coaching so a big challenge can be not trying to coach someone that's not willing to be coached so really understanding your team and I guess it's like with any project even you need to understand the stakeholders you need to understand the people you're dealing with understanding the communication needs really think about their needs and adapting what I do and how I approach them to their specific needs yeah and that's I think that individual style of you know trying to figure out what is a person's personality what is the working style and and working around that I think is is your approach to managing and growing and play a team of business analysts so let's switch gears a little bit and talk about some of the more practical aspects of actually delivering Solutions so product management is a role it's an up-and-coming role that has gained a lot of popularity in the last couple of years I'm wondering if you can speak to us about some of your experiences managing different products inside of organizations financial institutions or any of the other experiences that you've had sure I would say a majority of the the products work that I've done has been on regulatory products so products that sit within a regulatory framework so for example products which have taxable benefits but in order to do that so most of my experiences and then and as well as defining all of the the rules for that up front making sure that they were delivered we made sure we had the MVP of the minimum viable product launched in line for when the legislation kicked in so we're actually able to facilitate one of our clients opening the very first one of these but then looking at the backlog of other requirements so building that list and maintaining it prioritizing it so that we can get those subsequent releases out to the clients so that they have a more robust a more flexible product and then building that on keeping in constant communication with them to understand the priorities you know the other delivery Cycles we had as a software house what we had to do in terms of other regulatory deliverables what resources available against what the clients wanted so that we can get an effective release out to them so continually developing those products in a way that the client is going to see additional value coming to them regularly right right and building so the type of product you just described is a product where you basically have a set of clients that are external to your own organization that are going to be using that end product that you're building for them and as a product owner or a product manager many times that is one scenario that you can be up against but another major scenario that oftentimes gets overlooked when we discussing product management and product ownership is the organization's own internal product needs so for example you'll have an organization that needs to launch a new HR System this HR System is exclusively for their own turn on use can you talk to us maybe a little bit about the differences in the role of the product manager for external products versus internal products and some of the challenges that each of them might have I mean I would actually say that there's a lot of similarities between the two and I wouldn't tend to draw a distinction for me it's the focus on what's the priority what's the available resource what's possible for us to deliver how can we get that value out what what's really important are the regulatory milestones we have to hit is there a market opportunity we have to to hit and one organization we would regularly have a fun team identify opportunities go to launch a new fund and then we would have to adapt priorities not just for that particular product but other products that were in process live as well so that we can manage the resource can I use the product backlog managed the backlog for each of the individual products as well alright alright so it can be I think a little more complicated when you've got multiple products versus a single product but I would say that the difference between internal and external and not huge still looking at how to get the value out what's the most important priority given the resources what can we effectively deliver and I think part of the important thing that you touch on there is the fact that as a product manager you're not necessarily focusing even though you might be managing one product yourself and your organization might have multiple products there should be some recognition of the fact that your products oftentimes are not living in isolation so many times if you have some sort of a feature that needs to get released to the client in one product that can be oftentimes either constraints that you have to live by because there are other products that your product is living with or there can be some other capabilities in other products that you might be able to leverage so I think it's important as a leader what your demonstrating for us here is the fact that you understand that product management can be much more complex than oftentimes many people can think about it when they're just thinking about trying to get one single product out without really paying attention to the entire portfolio of products that in organization can have so that's a that's a very important point there now just for scenario base thinking for for ourselves I'm wondering if we can really just kind of thought talk through about how we would tackle a certain initiative so let's imagine that are senior leadership strategic at the Strategic level of organization has decided that they are going to enter a new market what the new line of business or a new product let's say we are a mutual fund company or some similar company to that and we want to get a new product a new business product out let's say a new type of fund out and we've recognized that we may need to do some extensive work inside of our organizations to build the capability to roll this new product out and to support it ongoing can you talk to me as a more senior leader about some of the things that we have to do in order to be able to roll out this larger type of initiative sure I would say that first of all the the very first thing you I will always suggest everyone does is work at exactly who the stakeholders are that needs to be involved you know what are the different teams in for a small isolated product you can do that fairly isolated within an agile team and a limited number of people who won as a larger initiative in a larger products perhaps in the processes then we need to involve more than just a small team so we need to understand who from the different teams around the organization need to be involved for example do we need the operations team do we need the accounting team do we need the sales team and who is the most appropriate person within those teams that need to be involved particularly in those discussions up front but absolutely on an ongoing basis and from a product management perspective they're going to be the the people that I'm going to be talking with the about you know what's the highest priority how do we look at the backlog what's the most important things what are the things that we need to make sure you'll be delivered and bring the compliance team in to make sure that we're hitting the regulations correctly and then look at what the needs are for each of those teams what the impact is of this new product does it mean we need to change the processes does it mean we need to change the software does it mean we need to change the manual processing and how do those pieces fit together and what's the evolution of that you know how do we look at do we need to split this into multiple phases how do we do that phase delivery and at which point do we need to bring the training in which point do we need to bring in other experts or subject matter experts in you know which point are we going to be ready to actually start working on the development of this and what's the target date for so a lot of different factors but really always focusing on what's the highest priority what's the minimum thing that we can deliver to get the value out there for this product and how do we manage the impacts of that together put in the plan together looking at the dates what's realistic what the impacts are of if we need to bring more functionality in do we need to slip the dates can we slip the dates and what are the impacts yeah and that's excellent I think that you really are focused on making sure that the internal resources are coordinated and mobilized is a very important part of making sure that that this type of a large initiative doesn't face any major obstacles because often times in organizations that try to do very large scale transformation or roll out changes of this manner oftentimes you'll find that you have the buy-in of many people in your organization but you might not necessarily have the buy-in of everybody in the organization so you mentioned compliance for example who in many organizations and many financial institutions the compliance organizations allowed at a time is stretched very thinly because of the fact that the financial industry is so well regulated that compliance really needs to be on the ball in their kind of need to be ever present in most parts of the organization and often times in those types of projects it can be very difficult to secure the time and the resources that you need to be able to to have them engaged in your project to make sure that you're okay from a compliance perspective so if you are ever in a situation where you're seeing for example that a very key stakeholder who you need for the project is really not interested in taking part are there some things that you can do to try to get those folks more engaged I think it comes back to earlier about really understanding the stakeholders and their individual needs and that sing the way that I'm interacting with them to get their buying you know how do I make that connection how do I build that trust how do I get them to understand the benefits of what yeah yes people are busy and but it's working with them to try and understand how can we actually do this together right this isn't something for me this I'm here to facilitate for you how can I make your world a better place and if let's say that is I think normally for most practitioners you always want to make sure that you're taking a software approach showing people the benefits of doing things the right way but often times if you're dealing with a group who really just doesn't have the buy-in or they don't have the resources you can still run into a dead end so do we have any tools in our tool belt is there any other approaches that we can use as a method of Last Resort if we're still not getting the resources that we want I think it's the same with any conflict and often you know I would like in Conflict to the example where maybe you have a sales team that wants to deliver something which is at odds with the regulations in the compliance team to bring those heads together and facilitating that conversation and again I think it comes back to that discussion around product management and prioritization you know as a product manager you're going to want to bring those stakeholders together and discuss the restrictions that each of those team members have you know how do we manage that what's the real priority for the organization facilitate that discussion you know I've shared change approvals where we have to really negotiate between the teams and the heads and the sea level stuff there you know what's the most important thing for the organization do we have to to take a hit in some areas in order to be able to get this greater good right and so really it seems to me like you're approach to this would be in making sure that there is a broad involvement especially on a large scale initiative like this that has maybe the buying of the CEO of the board and of all the other senior leadership to that it seems like would be to make sure that this is Bradley communicated and the leadership of the organization has the obligation really to prioritize their resources in one initiative versus another one so I think that that's typically the approach in many organizations where when you have senior leadership oftentimes you need to get access to either the senior vice president or the CEO themselves to to make sure that they are really very clear about their about their own priorities so I think that's a that's a an approach that works very well in many organizations and so in terms of the questions that I wanted to go through I think I've learned everything about your background and your profile and have a good sense for what you're capable of doing is there anything else that you would like for us to discuss well I'd like to say thank you because I think this is a great initiative and it's a great way of sharing experiences part of what's important for me is continually learning absolutely different things to pick up and I think this is a great way of making knowledge more available to the wider audience yeah absolutely absolutely and I want to thank you because I think that the perspective that many of our junior or aspiring professionals are lacking are the perspective of senior leaders who have really been on the ground in the at the implementation level so appreciate you spending the time with us to impart some of your knowledge in helping the more junior members of our community really understand how things are viewed by by the leadership of of organizations absolutely I mean I think this doesn't matter how well you're doing something there's always a better way yeah yeah and to our audience members I will be leaving contact information for Simon so please feel free to reach out to Simon and connect with them for for anything that you want and I want to thank you again Simon for appearing on the show and imparting your very valuable knowledge and will be in touch thanks and have a great day take care

in this video I have invited nitish Kumar who is inspiring data analyst basically a fresher who is looking out for a job in the power bi rule is the potential pressure and you will see in the future he will definitely secure a job in this video I will be taking his power away interview and I hope he performs very well so let's start the video and before that if you need to the channel then do subscribe it and hit the Bell icon to stay updated with all the coming useful videos you can follow me on Instagram learn with gigs where you will get regular job related updates as well it's short videos on its domain and friends do hit the like button of this video because you're one like will give me the motivation to create more videos like this now let's head towards the internet so my name is nothing I am 2023 graduate I have skills in power bi sequel Python and Excel I have worked up on several personal projects in which I have utilized these tools to solve real-world problems while working on this project I have worked upon data extraction data cleaning data modeling data analysis and data visualization part so like how many projects and in Python I have done one project on Spotify okay let's start with the first question so suppose you have three tables okay in power query and the structure of all those three tables are like similar to each other now you went ahead and upended those three tables okay but okay so you have upended now now if you want to do the clothes and apply so what will happen all those three initials plus that appendage of all those three tables will be loaded in power bi right yes but I don't want those three tables to be loaded I only want that appendix table to be loaded in power bi how will you manage this so in power query we have an option to we have option to enable road then from there we have to check that and then we will close and apply then only that particular queries do you know when when do we use have you used index column yes I am using text column what kind of scenario do we use index in my in my case my table was not having a primary key and I wanted to establish a relationship between the between two tables period and then I will check on column quality or column profile then from then from that we will be able to get a summary of our prayer column where we will be able to see how many distinct value of a column is containing and how many total values our colon is having if suppose that column contains around 20000 records OK Google yes can you tell me what is basically it's a similar to join in Sequel so suppose we want to we want to create a master table based upon based upon some other table then in that case we want to join two tables so by using a common column between both the tables we can join we can create that master table so much we have left what is left in the world from left table is not present in the right table so how do you differentiate how do you differentiate that when we see when like in general in fact table there are there are more number of data presents like there are more number of rows patients and if we see that there are some columns which are which are repeating in the table then in that case we will consider that table is a fact table but what happens in a dimensions are not represented means we will be getting the data testing Google this is and and Festival will be continuing the quantitative data and diamond WWE containing the quality of vitamins Dimension table will be having information about any particular Dimension can you explain what is a snowflake schema reduce the data redundancy okay what is cardinality cardinality means the theaters cardinality represents the relationship between two tables like how these two tables are related so this can be one to one minute to many so ideally what kind of cardinality we should prefer one too many relationships turn off slices wild in the donut chart we have the information present in the form of arts and in the Donut chat there is a hole in between and in pie chart there is no hole in between so basically the Donut chat is just a variation of a pie chart means upon requirements like what kind of visuals will be suited for our report visualization how can you differentiate a measure with a calculator and it will not be taking any extra amount of calculated what is a page level filter base level three and if you go to any other place will not be affected by this filter have you set up yes how do we how do we do that firstly Ford filter we must have a hierarchy of data like if you want to enable drill through for some great column then we must have a hierarchy of year then month and and then date and when we drag and drop that thing on our visual then that will be automatically enabled our and there is a fork like icon and if you click on that phone like I can then we will be able to do you know how to do how to set up a customer service on any particular visual for which we want to we want that to visual so we have to link that tooltip to that particular visual then if the hover over that visual then we will be able to see that in our business period I want to see the total sales of country India for example of country India should be visible okay so how do you create a measure for that I think I have to use so you are telling our power report we have to use calculate calculate function then inside the caliper function as a filter modifier we have to we have to pass the country name is India there okay now the next part is if we also have a country slicer yes so 544 how do the iterator functions work like the functions which ends with X how do you work so it basically goes Rose by Rose and then then apply the condition which we have written inside the theater function and then according to that it gets the it gives the scalar value for each group what does filter function returns a subset of our tablet tablet is there any difference between last year I do not think like I do not think there is any difference between these two phones because if so what kind of license as a developer you should have to do this we should have a license because it is it will it will be economically economically viable for that company to get to use that so if I say that nothing like I just said I can say to you that organization you have a blue license you will say yes right yes if I say to you do you have a premium license so is that right there is a difference between Pro license and premium license suppose if you ask me that you have a pro license then I will say yes but when you asked me when you say to me or do you have a premium license then in that case I will say know why because premium license is is to an organization other than any individual person so what organizations to that it's usually okay do you know about this so what can you do as a developer I can I can publish the report and I can assign a member I can assign a new user which will be having access level lower than OK Google weather in Mumbai and our awesome team which works on sale and we want that team to just see the data about cells so in that case we will be using the whole level security to show that team just the data options and enrollable security there are two types like one is a static and one is dynamic so in a static we each time we want to assign an accessible to any particular user then we have to do it but what is that we give the filter or email address to the table to the table to and then when we want to give the access then into Power service we just entered the email ID of that person then that person will be able to get the access according to his shoes okay what is a data Gateway do you remember yes so so much OK Google turn on more than 95% of the questions you said the right answer obviously from the power be a service side you don't have much exposure so we can expect that thing but other than that you have a good knowledge and you are really doing good so all the best because whatever you are doing just keep doing that and I think in the coming time you will definitely get a job as a fresher thanks for your business

good afternoon are you thank you for joining in today's interview session how are you doing today morning sir I was doing great thank you for asking so before we proceed can you give a brief introduction about yourself I graduated from economics 2019 okay so since you mentioned that you graduated in the year 2019 and since then what you have been doing so far for a couple of years I pursued civil services I gave a couple of times I cleared them last year so after that I decided to do the certification so there are so many technologies that are available right now in the market right like java.net many others so why have you chosen business intelligence to be your domain why power bi why not any other technology actually when I was doing it I wasn't much fascinated by it because I wanted I really wanted to play with you so I have always been fascinated with data so I like I like to go to the places where I can use the logical reasoning analysis and I can play with the things and I can pick up my stories I can talk to the clients and all so then it is period that I got into this was just just just something that I want you and that's why I decided to give it a shot okay so if I have to ask you to describe three things about power bi what are the three things that you would like to bring to my notice that you have learned from this tool or which has helped you to understand more about data and making sure that you create some awesome visualizations and performing on analysis so first of all the way the very first thing that is good about okay that it actually allows you to gather the data you just set it up from variety of data sources create any server or database or you can even perform a directory without actually getting in the data into the call yet so there are variety of data sources that you can pull into analyze your data the second of all it is also has an idiot where you are transformed the data it gives you very user-friendly interface that you can within a click of a few miles to and the last one I would say it's the power bi service the cloud-based system of the power yet where you can build interactive dashboards very powerful dashboards which you can share with you know multiple developers with your team also they provide you the services for streaming data the real time data they also give you the benefit of the date of course that is the power on the online basically and it is independent of the data set so that helps you differently that's great would you like to talk about the project that you might have worked with power bi yeah so I worked on a mini project with my organization okay so you mentioned that you worked under the Age of Mythology okay so can you describe me how the Sprint planning have been done in your project what was the duration of the Sprint and what all activities that you had done in the entire process can you explain it so first of all I was also have a project manager so he interacted with the client he understood the entire project whatever the business how many developers were involved in this entire project we had six tables so right so when we are working as a team there are give me a times that there are lots of opinions from different people right due to which it might lead to the rise of conflicts when you are working in a team so in case it happens with you in future that you had been working in a team and there are some conflicts of opinions that is coming into picture how you going to react to it or take this and resolve this issue if it happens first of all it is very important to understand the problems from everyone's birthday wishes should not be we should not be focused on our individual cells or individual problem we should always look it from the clients for prospective what they want and what do they expect us to do and we should do it about me that's awesome so if I have to ask you to highlight three strands who are you and you want to bring it to my notice to make this High hiring process easier what what all things you would like to highlight so first of all I like to do things very fascinated by analysis I am very fascinated that's great any weakness that you think that you might have meetings so the business I might have trouble that's great so I think I'm done with the insurance will start with the technical round if you want to have a glass of water in between you can have so if I have to ask you to rate yourself out of five in power bi how much you want to rate yourself so if I have to tell you what are the building blocks of the building alright so what type of databases have you handled using power bi so far left and then I have connected to the Super Service and some databases like so have a good time in the territory so normally how do you create or manage relationships in power bi desktop yeah so after the transformation okay so you mentioned about schema right can you describe what is a schema for in the best of my understanding what I have to schema is basically you know it's a part of a database that holds the table that holds a different tables and it comprises of it in the best of my understanding so can you tell me what is a surrogate celebrate support okay alright alright alright so talking about the dashboard that you might have created in power bi so what all different kinds of charts you have created any custom chat you might have created in any of your projects can you explain what is the Power view yeah how is it different from a power query so can you explain the difference between some function and some function yeah some function is okay so I believe you have used that you also mentioned about that so what are the benefits of using that's very using variables in deaths so variables variables actually cancel cancel can you connect to power bi like ice like I said in the beginning there is nothing to Cloud Post Office and there were ideas so so right now there are two visualizations tools that are there in the market like Tableau and power bi are you aware of table as well so why you think organizations would be using power bi more and not Tableau why you are going for power bi and not for Tableau first of all there's a case of beer and it's not that complicated and second floor you can do all of the normalization stuff all over the standardization so it basically helps us to do everything at one place we don't have to shift to other things again and again for the different ways for the different processes so that I can okay what all different views that power Be at stop container report okay and do you know about remind me to many relationships in power bi and how to handle it so yes so I can explain many to many relationships as such that you know we have different things so we have a primary key and we have so many instances of a primary key is related to the many instances of foreign a different table then that case is called a miniature helps us together okay and are you aware that how the data security what is implemented in power bi yeah so there are a few days with the data security and passwords where we can assign and we can figure out and then we can assign different uses a particularly that this department of a particular organization like financial department of security can you give an example yeah so like I said that Finance the suppose the finance department should only look at the financial field service so we can figure out we can go to the marriage in our home address in the morning so I'm outside I wish can you describe your role as a polar bear developer yes I can describe it by the project that I did in the project we had six of the developers so when the other project manager when I was talking about have you got a chance to work on data transformation what is difference between DirecTV and another important then the I want to be a he has to go all the way to the sequel server and it has to gather the data from the door so it is slightly inefficient slightly slow when you are visualized compared to when your visualizing the data from Time OK Google are different backgrounds so for that I for better representation of my results have you published a report so can you tell me what is Gateway is like a bridge what is the report services list of many different sheets and you can put in a very different visuals and we can analyze the data and that's it and then what is that dashboard dashboard is actually the collection of business services and is it possible to create all this dashboard and report from Power okay then why do we require using alphabetic stuff for using the properties I believe there are many features that you can play your data from the service what is difference between what is different between I have I have tried to use the power apps to my workplace but I wasn't so when I use the app service station do you have any questions to any one of us about so I'd be really glad I'll be ready for you if I could get a better question so that is only concerned and everything absolutely so when you will be working working in a team you will you will definitely come across people who will have similar mindsets like you with whom you your frequency will match so I believe that when you have been matches with someone at that time you jealous with that person you can share things with them and then it becomes a better environment at the workplace so it's the communication that is very important when you talk freely talk and share about your ideas without getting into the politics of the industry then I think life becomes quite easier in the organization itself and I'm very sure that if you are selected you will be working in a very healthy and that that will actually run the weakness that you were thinking that is there a new it is actually not a weakness it is basically the environment that actually affects you when you are in that zone so anyways thank you once again for joining in today's interview we'll meet very soon with the feedback session and will tell you exactly what are the areas of improvements for today's interview have a wonderful day ahead thank you bye

friends welcome back to our Channel learn with geeks in this video I have invited Hershey srivastava for the power by mock interview he is an aspiring data analyst and is working very hard on his technical skills as well as on his communication skills to get his first job as a fresher in data analytics to me so now let us proceed with the interview part and before that if you're new to the channel then do subscribe it and hit the Bell icon to stay updated all the coming useful videos and you can also follow me on Instagram and friends if you love the content then do hit the like button hello harshit how are you I'm fine thanks for asking can you briefly introduce yourself and afterwards I have given few years for government exam preparation and and after quitting government then I started learning data analytics and and has done few projects in power bi and still my learning process is going on so what is your current technical skills my skills are power bi Sequel and Excel so how many reports you have built in law in power bills so what kind of data source have you used to connect Bluetooth device and loading on a local machine and here there is a limit on data of 1 GB to be published to power bi service and Performance Bike it is better and faster than other connection mode and how's the different from DirecTV internet connection for example and if you have to open the two tables so what is the necessary condition to tables first condition is that both have same column name and the second condition is data type of each column okay and what do you mean by margin functionality in power query when when we have two or more columns and we want to we want to add it to an existing table so in that case we we use much function and we join them on the basis of a common problem and and there are different types of merchants have a column called name called for example your name is written and other names are written like complete name is now as for the requirement we want to take out the first name from that column in a separate column so how will you do that in power query we can use transform we can split the column using the Eugene like space or using Facebook and the opposite if you have to do this for example you have the first name you have the last name of a customer for example and you have to merge or combine those two to generate a caller which contains the first name and last name and how will you do that in that case we can use much column option OK Google how how are Dimension table is different from a fact table you know that all the tables are differentiated on the beaches of Dimension facts right so how Dimension Dimension contains Master data and which does not changes frequently with time and it contains it contains a primary key through which it is connected to the fact table it contains measures and the dimension key through which factor which connected to Dimension Table and there is one to many relationship from Dimension to Fat okay so you said there is a foreign key primary relationship so how do you determine that okay this column will be used as a primary key in this table and this column will be used as a foreign key in the factory so how do you differentiate like how do you determine this column I have to use for creating a relationship so first it can be it can be determined by changing it contains unique values if someone is there and it is containing unique value then it can be used as a primary key okay and how will you check that that column has unique values change by clicking on the column quality there we can check how many numbers of distinct values and unique values are there and OK Google will you do something for this relationship so that get results no I will not support this type of relationship because front of the column through which water tables are connected and afterwards we have to create a relationship between vegetable to the first table through that column and this relationship will be one too many and also we have to join this table through to the other table also through one to many relationships in the starting so what kind of schema you have practiced in now in the morning what kind of building in to multiple tables and other than that everything is image star schema like one Festival is connected to many Dimension table and the fact table is present at the center and the same overall shape looks like of a star okay so what kind of visuals you have used till now in your reports like what are all different kinds of visuals you have used in the report in the reports yes so I have scattered about yes so what do you mean by like what is the standard time and segments of category with respect different from a normal filter that we have in the filter pane of this slicer is different from a filter pin or is it or are they both the same slices and filters know they are not safe by clicking on edit interaction option which which is present in format table so so first of all I will check whether it is on edit induction option is on or off if it if it is off then I will on it and second I will check whether there is a proper relationship between the tables which are loaded in power Bi Rite so according to me when this type of problems support we want to have the total sales of country India for example yes only sales of country India so how will you create a measure for this can you write the message in the chat box yes sir I want to kill you if I'm thinking if on slices three countries and every time when I am which should give the result of total number of cells that have occurred in India forget that you have a slicer on the report just think that we have a card Visual and we have to create a measure which should give the result of total sales of India okay okay okay fine okay I should have to calculate the last month or the previous episode right yes or do you know about the okay do you know about the same period last year function yes so where is it useful it is useful when we want to get some data of previous year for the same period data from the table which is present on the one side so for facing the data we create a major enough table and then using related function the Federal Credit Union access you have total sales and on XXX you have months from January to December but when you have put months on xx's the Sorting order of the months is not in the right because the first will be January but it is starting with March okay some random some random values are there or all the 12 months are there but they're not ordered in the right way we have to order it in the right way from January to December so if this kind of situation is happening how will you resolve it first of all I will go to Table in power query editor and afterwards I will create a calculated I will create a calculator column which will be Monday and it can be done through so much and afterwards what's the message of this new calculator so how did the service not much but only I published mine report to power service so do you know about security yes I know so soft right yes so what's the difference between a pro license and a premium license as a developer as a developer which is kind of license you should have one should have license okay and how Pro license different from a premium license is a premium license a user base license know it is capacity visualizations premium license is preferred by organizations and what kind of do you know about different kind of access levels that we have service for any report do you know about admin access control computer accessories so how are you like Alexa's different from a contributor level access in Beaver beaver level access only time it is for them and user and take an only view the report and they can't do any modifications access taken they can do the modifications if required and also they can grant access to the end user or viewer and what do you mean by dataflows data flows are the Transformations done on the data in power bi service and teach transformed data can be can be loaded and it can be it can be used to report services so whenever so should we talked about roller security a few minutes ago do you know about user principal name that function yes I know so what does it do it displays the text of name of Loudoun County

say hi to Brooklyn good afternoon Google and in Excel I'm good with the pivot tables we look up its look up xlookup index match reporting on power wheel and go to the next video analyst so can you please tell me the rules and responsibility you are doing that project my Rowland responsibility as well as to date for mainly for data cleaning data services so how would you rate yourself in a scale of 10 10 being the highest I will let myself eat out of 10 we have our panel he would be going through your room so over to you something please OK Google start and I use a text from salsa to standardize text into standard is one and I use a lawyer and offer a formula mostly used to standardize text value these functions are you okay okay okay okay okay okay so can you please tell me what are the parameters one is the main substance and then we have to pass the starting point we have to specify that how many number of characters do you want to extract from the main street okay okay all right so can you please tell me the difference between a primary key and foreign key primary key and foreign key both are constant and primary key is constant which the column to have a duplicate and non values while foreign key established a relationship between tables do you know what is normalization okay so depending on their performance this ratings are given all right so I want to give let's say one people who have got one rating I want to give them 20% hike people who have got two rating I want to give them 15% hike so how do you achieve this how can I do this I can achieve this by update command and using case status where close is executed after from from command while having classes implemented after the weight loss is executed okay so can you use aggregate function Plus Los Angeles located in New Jersey license I have got some negative numbers I want to get rid of I want to get rid of the sign Okay negative sign okay so what is the numeric function you're going to use there we can use the absolute apps so what is what is the viewer temporary results so what is the use of index is a find the police please stream so tell me how do you use power bi I use a little bit more so what is the use of you what is your notice period thank you

Transcription for C:\Users\ankus\OneDrive\Desktop\AtharvAI\output_audio_files\audio_11.wav:
can you please tell me a little bit about yourself so my name is Harsh so I started my career as a production support executive for a couple of years and around 2 years there I work with Oracle and unique selling Etc and I was providing a support to the application called HP service manager then I shifted my text text to at night and then I shifted my career to cloud and I also got an opportunity to work on one side location where I started my cloud journey and in Cloud I have experience to gcp and at 0. 0 0 6 I have a team of 10 members and Technologies I'm working on ADF databricks by spark and little bit of python okay so total is around 8 to 10 years of experience here right yeah yeah 9 years okay great so shall we start with the idea of part first yeah sure okay so can you tell me how you will move the data from on Pandora in case of on Prem to Cloud migration we need to create the integration runtime manually by using a cell phone status integration run time so we need to we can download that that is kind of software we can download from is your website and we can install that into on Chromecast is not good enough and why we need cell phones to indication time is actually like it automatically decide like where the target is hosted right so because that are disconnected settings it cannot buy pass the firewall so we need to manually install the software into on sale service how cell phone you can bypass the firewall and why Auto result cannot bypass what I mean what extra you will do what is the difference there so in case of self-hosted we are manually installing the software right and after installing the software we are installing the same integration run time in Cloud side as well and there we are generating a key and that key we are mapping to on on Prince Right while installing the software on the cloud print services that that key is belongs to the cloud site that integration Center gets connected to the cloud on Samsung Cloud get connected by using that we can simply create a pipeline like we do for sale like your company and on the right hand side you have an on-prem of let's say Oracle and that is for the company too okay now I want to transfer the data from one to on Primm two using ADF how we can do that you got the question we can create a common staging location in the cloud service we can host a weekend first to connect our first company on trim service directions I want you to run a pipeline on every last working day okay of the month now how you will design that pipeline how are you so we can use it the last last day of the month let's take an easy last day of the month I think there is an option to we can take Mark to use that I like run at the last working day last day of the month that we can do that's fine that's fine now let's take it to the next level last working day not the last day now last vacation Monday to Friday and if there is a holiday at the Friday it should be like Thursday and if it is Thursday it's a holiday it should be like ovens to calendar of each month manually because it cannot be decided by the system because it depends like someone some holiday might come and like we can manually create a file and we can take a look up on that file then using the tumbling window trigger that last working day it will take from the file and as soon as that matches with that filed it will trigger to some condition we need to write yeah exactly in schedule so it's possible but I'm not sure very very much because if we want to do some customer service put some particular interval then we use the schedule window treatment and if we need to do some customization or some like you said like we need to like we need to like you skip the runs propose and and if you need to like using the same trigger if you need to run multiple of pipelines or some kind of customization if it is required then we use that I'm not getting the exact scenario in my mind something which is not a state for what they need Tumblr okay no problem okay let's talk about the few things on to the Parkside as well you can write barcode and high school sometime soon now this file is a CSV file okay now while you reading the CSV file the CSV file is we called it is not like every room is not just a number one line so I will get ended up in a multiple lines so let's say of one row of a table is like comprises of let's say five lines second row is also comprised of three lines like that so in the CSV file your one row is represented not by just one line but it's like a multi-line so every day is a multi-line rose how you doing such kind of whether it is possible at all or not possible if possible then it's a CSV file yes CSV file I think it is possible so we need to give an idea is equal to spark Dot read.csv and there is an option we need to give like multi-line is equal to 2 I think so that we can use a problem are you sure I'm not sure but I think so some options do you heard about the complex Jason value inside file if it is there then it is known as complex station make sense now imagine that you have to read a complex Json file in the spot how do you do that dot okay no worries date so let's keep this song now till this point here itself so let's get into the second part of this entire mock session that is like a feedback part so first of all I feel that you didn't exceedingly good job a few things which we can you know change a bit but whatever the monks I have taken it I think you are quite well prepared okay so let's first thing my first suggestion you know a lot of things and you need to be confident of yourself okay I can see that out of let's say I ask around 8 questions and out of that almost seven questions you have answered almost right almost right so you know a lot of things you need to be a little sound little bit more you know confident maybe it's a mock interview that's why you could be not that confident or I mean it's not that way but yeah you can be confident coming to the first question when we talked about the integration on time you were right that the cloud we need a selfish immigration on time then we talked about it why why we need it then you said it correctly that there's a firewall problem and that is there so there is a small one thing that you need to understand when I say that that how the cell phone indication on time will allow me to make a connection and why Auto Reserve will not allowed to make a connection you said it like you giving the keys here and there so that is just like the registering the cell phones to indication that is nothing to do with the connection okay so you install one machine you install the cell phone on that machine and you make a cell phone screen indication on time into your area of account and that you just registered each other there isn't the reason why is indication and time is Maya connection because the machine on which your cell phone is installed have an access to your so maybe this is coming into the same network or at least if it is not in the same network this is specific machine IP addresses fixed so this fixed IP address might have been white label or you know why did it into the fireball of that server so then if any connection coming from that machine probably will be allowed and that is why generally this is a selfish allowed to make the connection so this clarification needed okay then coming to the next stop when I when I asked like on premium you said it like put the staging layer in between there is almost right because technically understand technically it is not possible that two different system two different companies two different on-prem can be run by the same mostly it is not possible okay so because it's between whenever you're doing between the two private it's not possible the way is like you put it in the staging and then you do it because like both of them have a different because when copy activity uses it uses only one self-hosted higher so probably you need one cell phone you need one from two so that that is a problem so easy solution could be like you can put it in between the staging put that the staging data I mean staging area and then copy that so you are almost right on that there as well but be confident that's the point so that cloud to Cloud right then we talked about the last day on the last day of the month you were right there is always options you can pick that option I think that option comes for that option is going to come for the your schedule even trigger as well now the problem comes in when we say that last two working day you said it like tumbling window needed tumbling window is not necessary its tumbling window does not have any condition like that so the condition that you need to put is at your like you may be using the effectivity so if activity would be doing that conditioning so maybe you have one you said it right that you have a look up maybe in the table or in the file which is have a holiday list you pick the dates from there and you check it like okay if today's date is not I mean let's say I'm running it I would just take like tomorrow day is a working day or not if tomorrow is a working day probably and it's not the last day of the month you know it makes sense like that so you have to use some kind of an if if you follow whatever it is whatever comes along but family is not the right solution okay and then we talked about difference between the tumbling window and the schedule triggers completely wrong okay there was play don't answer so can you schedule triggers can associate with multiple pipelines but tumbling window associated with the only one pipeline but you said I mean other way around okay tell me when you can set the retries you can set the concurrency you can set the dependency with the other tumbling window all these options are there which is not there in the schedule event tickets OK Google that there is an option of multi-line and that will solve your problem of getting the multi-line CSE compilation I think if I'm not wrong at this point you don't need to have anything for the competition you just read a simple like the way you are getting it will read only the difference is when you try to access it so when you try to exit you have to you know you like dot operators so the first Jason you will see the data frame column name is a data frame dot call 111 and if that column name has another decency is a colony of that so you just only difference comes is when you access that value otherwise I think complex Jason also read in the exactly the same manner there is no other country music great so I think you did good I feel that is quite strong a little bit here and there if you try spark also looks good even though you're not spent too much time because you are a little bit on the time but I think you're doing well and you know a couple of things you have to just be confident when you answer it so be confident because when you answer it it feels like you little bit trying not very sounds confident so whatever you say be confident okay yeah that's that's it thank you so much okay great

okay so can you tell me the current project that you're working on so basically my work is related to like data scientist they create so it's basically email office is not like not detailed pipelines creation so mostly what I do is like data scientists create their own machine learning models and I deploy them I create pipelines in airflow to deploy those models into the virtual environment like staging and production okay so that's the yeah and what programming languages can you just tell me like what are the services and what was the flow like how are you social services so for sure like mostly for detail pipeline creation I have is 88 as you did a factory so I was creating Dynamic detail pipelines there and I mean including all those variable things and everything and I was utilizing like keyboard to store all this like credential parts and everything and then I should be so I still integrated and create some dynamic programming inside so what we had in the database notebook that in the customer service internet getting generated in the database notebook and then we used to published out in the month or sometime today what is the difference between data Lake and italic is basically same so but in the Delta Lake we have some added advantage of like we have Community catalog where we can add some quality checks and also like permissions to the different layer of data like we have silver layer brunch near so we can use that you look at look at that advantage of that later okay so what is the exact use of as you mentioned what is exactly like why is it needed in the first place so suppose there's any companies that like listening and not all of them are all of them need to be getting access to all layers of data so supposedly start working in the project and they don't need to get access to the old lady they just need to get access to the clean part like a cold and let's say data Engineers they need to access the role of data where all the transformation losses will be applied all the cleaning parts will be done so that's why we need to separate all these things so like Enterprise level software we need to give access properly so people can work like there will be more like data governance so have you worked on data profiling any tools or anything not exactly OK Google in the first place let's see some sample data you need it basically creates a generic script OK Google set the values of correctly properly populated for those five columns it shouldn't be like name column has some integer values so this mapping this kind of thing data profiling does so you mentioned about data governance as well could you just take me like what you how you have implemented data governance in any of your projects using in the catalog or any other tool just an idea of what you understand by data governance yeah so yeah in our project only we have to do like the auditor is to come from different sources sometimes it's coming from streaming from there we used to collect all the data into a little late or maybe less location and from there to like transform the data clean the data and put it into it has been separated you different locations in defense independent locations or something create different files are maybe sometimes in a different School database or maybe later so it's not it was not fixed for every scenario there are different requirements from the client site so based on that give me an example of One Republic Services different type of permissions so no one I mean not everyone is still able to access all this players and then he needs to go to the gold and go there will assess was given to the high level employers means that manager or maybe senior send it so yeah so that's how it was divided into the different layers and that's how it is to apply and all this information and all these things were I mean credentials were stored in keywords and keyboards access was given to from Azure this is like single thing okay so understood so what I just want to understand from you is like can you just tell me one or two or three maybe key features of the unity catalog like you said that's perfectly fine anything apart from that because just one one liners or some words would like some key features if you would say from what you have worked on what do you understand that Unity catalog exactly of course yeah one is due to governance and another is like the Storage level means that some data need not to be stored in like there are different levels of like sometimes we don't only to store the historical data for last 30 days or maybe some last one year so in row level I mean in the Bronx level live within didn't need to apply this kind of like like all data I mean sometimes it is to store it in a cold storage need it not to be accessed a very frequently but in the morning that access control as well yeah access control and like storage or sometimes what I can say like not which data was not able to access frequently was not can we also see that it offers the flow from the destination exactly how that is coming so basically it helps also in debugging right if there's any failure in between also in the pipeline you can use that for purpose as well that's good so okay just go through some of the most features to offer so some of them more okay all right so okay one more thing I want to know is two things I want to know is how much data you are dealing with and what kind of data is it what kind of files you are dealing with and what kind of data is in historical or incremental Delta load whatever so just explain that so data first of all data was no it was not limited even for now so it's not like fixed so mostly because from 1GB to 5G depends more than that and yeah and also can you please repeat history is it incremental what kind of data is it a number three is what kind of are you getting from the source and what is the file that it is being transformed into yeah sure so yeah mostly files I'm getting generated like CSV files and wish to convert the parking for me basically used to do that and yeah and what kind of data data history project we are not using such kind of things but in my old projects so you have been using Azure as well right now is this new thing in the market for sure have you had the chance to work on it not exactly mostly it was like in part of okay all right so can you tell me that what are the advantages of parking over other file formats what can first of all what kind of file format is so it is easier for when it's a problem and also it has like it is a compression technique so that's why the bike parks are more the size are very low temperature for some kind of aggregation so only we can take all this particular columns for the education do you know what predicate full stop what what exactly like what are the things why do you worked on Spotify it is temporary stored in particular station in the memories so it's very much more faster to access we can go on the data and also all this operations we are performing in the data frame it will be happening inside the memory and as like Spark so all these things will be like in the collection data shuffling stage it will be much more optimized if you're using data from okay and what about so there's a basic difference between data set and data frame can you call something you play we're not doing some pudding in the notebook so whenever I run the code after that we get home so that is run time safe today okay if you have your scholarly will see that during compilation only it will show you that it has this is a difference like compiled type safety gives you the error between during compile time only run time keeps doing that time so that's the basic difference between data and data frame as well dataframes do not give you compile time safety you will see it after you run but they said if you use if you convert into a data set you will get compiled and safety so this is a very big difference of other advantages so it depends on which one you want to use okay okay so you mentioned about lazy evaluation of can you explain that information so whenever there so those things can be like happening in white transformation so that time data needs to be shuffled in the like from 1:30 a.m. so when a white transmission is happening before that when the transmission is happening in a particular partition then all these things are like taking into the dead or in a graph all these things are not being compared so when you're collecting the data or maybe you have some white transformation and so it will wait for the college operation or maybe even so that's why it's called you okay so basically you what what is the conclusion like why is why is it so you mentioned about that do you know about lineage graph as well what is lineage graph something related to rdds yeah I mean I have to cancel OK Google what happens if what is happening in every step so basically if you added three is lost you get it from the lineage of this is what the things that were applied so that's the importance of lineage graph okay okay so you can Transformations so can you name some of the Transformations which you have used in your project and how do you use it like what was the use case and why was it needed yeah I mean there was a first level of use cases as if there was a lot of requirements to come from the customer service how can we know avoid that I mean we cannot avoid joining obviously we need to join two tables but how can we avoid I mean listen to shuffling before even joining the date of friends because I don't have a small world in them it will be a lot of traffic and I want to optimize that in this scenario I want to optimize that so what will be your approach to solve this problem first of all I need to understand why we were doing a little like after joining will be doing some operations into that pool table light that is the like that is the client has said that it's a must we will have to join so we can do like all the operations which will be happening and we can start all the parts that will be easier if you're joining the tables it will be already sorted the both parts and also so different different so maybe we are doing some applications or maybe some so we can do that part in the before joining also after doing that after something and then we can do that so that will listen to write so have you walked on police and repetition I have used can you explain like what is the difference and what it does reposition means like partitions can be increased or even decreased but call is only increase the volume decrease the volume so we are like we are like marching to partitions as a cold or something maybe we can join I mean join based on a particular criteria not join but maybe get a credit report from is created what happens after that I mean what happens after that doesn't what is the exact thing that happens after you submit this background there is like a plan gets created that how it will be executed in the background then it goes to the AQ means adaptive credit execution and it selects the most efficient method executed and that is in spark I think there's a version for it for a QE there's a version lyrics of some spiritual and above like a cube is enabled what I'm saying is that it respective of the version of spark so okay what are partitions first tell me what are partitions the condition is the partition of the data or maybe this town and yeah so that's basically partition yeah that is based on the data I'm talking in terms of spark has this partitions you can so the partitions as in like let's say 5 and those are divided into 11444 right so that is how it is created because the partitions will be created and then the data will Shuffle among the partitions know so that is the basic so that's what I'm saying so when you submit the spark of the partitions are created and then what you are saying is based on the data the data I mean across the data we will do the partitions that this will go into this partition and this will go into depart this partition so my scenario is when this partitions are created when you submit the spark shop number one how are the partitions created I mean what what is the criteria for this to be decided that how many practitioners will be created number one and number two is let's say you have to decrease the number of partitions okay so we have to options polish or republican so which one will be efficient for you are or which one would you choose to call Patricia okay so far how it is getting partition means first of all we can give the criteria the based on how it can partition if you don't give the credit then it will create like hash partition based on that will be partition the data I can see partition has maximum of 118 MB So based on how much data is there based on that little divide the partition so that I mean we can calculate the number of partitions based on that total number of data and amount of data and yeah cool is and reposition I think I'll be for reducing the data I think Coalition will be more efficient but I don't exactly remember the reason why you can't answer so have you used police station because there was a particular scenario that we have I had to calculate cumulative count for some data so some repeating data was coming and we still have a calculator that how many times did it's getting repeated before that I used to call is the data and yeah so where does school is happening because it happened in the driver many of the executor it happens to executed correct so and where does the partitions department is the most effective way let's say when your day is divided okay you don't understand 90% of the data and other partitions are empty more or less because 10% of that is just distributed so in this case there will be what there will be particular scenario what is the name of that one partition that is something more data that job will take a long time building more time as well because it has to process all that data and others are sitting empty so we have to eventually distribute the data so how can we do that we can either use School list or repetition but in this case if you see that one partition is creating more it contains more data don't you think that a full shuffling is needed because full shuffling what will it do it again full stop I mean evenly across the partitions so this is the kind of scenario when you can use repetition okay and cold is as you said like if you want to merge something is a better option yeah so yeah I mean to be exactly okay yeah so yeah more or less we are covered with spark their just go through like the you know basic concepts of it you know what happens in the back and when you run a spark job how are this partitions created in this partitions also have a relation with the number of CPU course your assigning when you run the spark job you assign some parameters as well write like number of course it will contain and how much memory you are giving so these are also I mean creating the number of particles there's a relationship with you see if you are able to access that OK Google what is the runtime for Publix what is a round tables configurations for using that what cluster you will use and there's some parameters also to be set so what is what is the date that you have used that is already assigned before projects so yeah okay so we will just cover python first okay so can you tell me the difference between deep copy and shallow coffee so run something into that objects found in the original and deep copy Concepts a new compound object and then recursively in search copies into the object on the door so what is the difference like what is the copy doing what is the exact difference in Shallow copy as you understand from the name itself right now references not the exact options OK Google okay okay have you walked on Pandora can you tell me the difference between a series and a data frame series means like as a list of talking there's a concept in Panda Express restaurant crazy run I'll write can you share your screen itself resume hey okay 97 you cannot read it two word streamers that is up to you Google can you tell me that I can check if the starting that if it begins with the same letter or not so I need to check the first percent increase will you tell me to Water Street so I need a look anyway so how can I check the first letter so I need to check for each other okay 0 0 1 okay just work on the syntax after the interview okay so you're splitting it and then taking the first index of the first word and first chocolate is in small letters so will it match when is an upper one is in small so will it return to convertible 1000 afterwards okay so just walk on the send text message to lower and then yeah 00 first letter first first word first letter second letter or second word first letter that you need to check okay just walk on the sentence that's the feedback okay okay I will quickly cover sequel as we are a bit out of time so okay I'll give you a scenario over here itself so let's say you know case statement right let's say you have kissed when to equal to bars and one equal to 9 then then three scenarios 3 van conditions what will be the output of each of them I forgot the difference so here it is not comparing the volume eight okay okay one last question is what is the difference between ranked and rank and row number and explain just with an example let's give you a data set like let's say name H salary what is the partition here Partition by name or is whatever considering partitions and ordered by everything lecture that is done just tell me that how will it assign the ranks over 4064 celery the salary it will give the angles one one okay okay so thank you for the internet 2008833 you just need to I think a little bit more yeah so right when the rank what it does is when it has died over here right it is 6060 is a time so 1:15 but it keeps the next track this will be three and this will be four it keeps number two because it is to two of them then set this problem it gives same number but it does not skip anything with the interview

welcome Raj for this interview on Azure data engineering road so can you please tell me about yourself I have completed my engineering in your 2019 from Mumbai University since then I'm having total 5 years of experience out of which my initial 2.5 years I have spent as a ETL consultant in which I was basically working with the databases and data warehousing and my recent 2.5 years of experience is in as a engineer in which I am using Azure data Factory database and have a good command over right spot and I have a background noise I have been into Sequel and this is Christmas so can you tell me about your project so my project is basically of like Insurance to me we are following basically Delta lake house architecture and here we are having like a million architecture which is on a Delta lake house so we are having a basically 3 years from Silver and Gold what we are doing is we are getting our data from multiple sources out of which one is from on Prem sequel TV which is nothing we are getting our three basic oil customer data Branch data and agent data from on premises so like that from other data we are getting in the form of directly from Upstream system in form of other because in insurance company we have to take a good understanding about weather as well so weather in formation we get from rest API once this information is better we just pulling this data with the help of ADF and loading it into our area is location and once this data is needed location then we perform different cleansing optimal activities and according to the business logic we are finally loading the data into our goal here and then from that our listing of power bi people and it can take away from there so what is the team size we are having we are seven people and others and how many pipelines you have in your project so yeah so in our project we are having 13355 minutes okay so far so it's like it's recently started project because 7 people and we have just like 30 35 lines so oh no I mean I have I have made 35 planes and in total in total there are more than 150 200 pipelines are there a big project okay so what is the most challenging situation which you face you have created a couple of pipelines so you might have encounter some of the problems so what do you feel that this is one of the most challenging situation you have been came across challenging situation yeah yeah recently we got this thing you know requirement from the client side that a certain pipeline should work only on you know only the business days like only when there are no holidays for the company so in schedule window in the schedule what we are having their we can just set like only to Monday to Friday we can set but there was this problem which we were facing if Suppose there is 15 August 15th holiday how to do that so far that was I took the initiative to myself what I did was I prepared directly or Excel file and which we put all the holidays which were there for our company from the company's calendar and just before running that pipeline we were having a basically we were having a look up activity that look up activity used to go into that file and check whether it is a holiday then we were putting a slope and if only if that particular date is not there then pipeline will run and in schedule schedule we are just putting it Monday to Friday so in this manner we have like made it possible yeah okay got it great so that's great so you said that you have and on premises Odessa system from which you are pulling the data so can you tell me what was exact that dear Source on what kind of a database it is and how exactly you pull the data from it is a SQL database Azure SQL database and we are pulling the data with the help of a copy of the music is it an on-premise is a cloud one oh oh my bad okay I was just thinking about another it was on premises okay now how you how you pull the data from Oracle on Prem to the cloud with the help of copy activity just only copy activities location in this pipeline we will use a a run time so actually there is also resolve integration run time which will not work in this case because we are pulling the data from on-prem so the data Google the data I hold it hold it you say normally Auto resolution's TV and it will provide the competition power over there from on premium and on premise and then only we can pull the data so generally why I mean the question means him why you need this helpful to indication run time why normal Auto resignation and time will not going to work when you feeling from this on-prem okay no worries no worries yourself it is coming into the landing container okay then yeah yeah yeah once the data is there in landing container with then we are again using the copy activity and we are pushing this data into the bronzer okay so you use a copy activity to push the return to the bronze layer so where is this is what kind of it is your hair is only okay bronze lyrics only now you copy the data from one Landing Zone to the translate okay then copied now then yeah once our data is there another Promise lyrics we add like flag to it so that when it when it is going to next year then we can identify this is this flag is just added to distinguish which data we have pushed further and which is a remaining so this is how the flag thing works so if my understanding is good you said that you first pull the data from your on Prem to the ADLs and that is in terms of a file or table yes yes is it yes it is a table so how you keep the table in adela's save it as a table it is it is getting saved underneath and in the form of it is a pocket file in adela's environment okay so it is a file in 88 ads in okay then what is the Brown's latest yes it is a it is a pocket file and only okay it is a pacifier but it is a table or it is a fine it is a fine just that we can access the file in the form of table because of this data lake house architecture we are using we are implementing Delta Lake up on it it is like a frame what do you say will go step by step OK Google then again you are using copy activity to move the data from your lending to the bronze layer right that is also a copy activity now where the Delta Lake comes in here you ask right so what is the format so that is why you keep it into the you copy it as a using copy activity you copying it as a file just wright Park a fighter so we are saving this file in right and this package is not operational in which we can what do DML operation and acid properties are there and we this this file will behave like a table and we can do all the commands like we used to do on the normal Warehouse normal table okay so you don't know about scenes like there is some confusion you might be talking about the databricks you started talking about the database not only the ADF because you cannot do this the email operation Etc in the the tables which are going to create like a spark tables okay okay okay okay okay okay you getting my appointment I'll come back to that in a few minutes okay so that all this get done okay now assume that all this is working fine so I assume you're using the database as well because as you said you're using for cleaning and all what size of data are getting in we are getting a play 5gb of data pipeline which is your talking about or overall you're talking about super pipeline we are getting a nearly half a GB of data per pipeline ok okay and you are doing that cleaning in the database using the spark okay how would you do this park performance optimization okay so there are an animal of using a spark performance the first way is that we can like if there are two tables on with the suppose joining is happening and we will see like if suppose any one of the table is smaller one we can go for broadcasting station so that during the joining operation essentially shuffling will be awarded because it will go and like each other table can join with a smaller table without any of so what we say data passing across what's the partition can we stopped and our time can be reduced this is one another one is we can use a broadcast joint sorry broadcast then we can use that this bucket bucket joint and this is the data is stored in form of like we can say on the lake joining is happening if on basis of country country so that whatever table which are there we will put them in Partition by Group by by country and the other table is also that and if the joining key for in case country they were also fall back in different different containers on Facebook of the country I just there is one condition that number of buckets for table one and table two should be same and then only can happen other than that there is something called as a repartition this we are doing to reduce the data skewness and apart from this there is an Adaptive which is Park internal optimization that we don't need to take care of spark on its own can optimize the query performance okay great thank you so much so I think let's get into the second half of this thank you for coming in so in the second half of this will analyze and will understand like where you did good and where you did little bit Improvement is needed okay so let's get started with this assessment so it's starting with it your presentation is good your comes is good so there you are doing perfectly well second thing is at 1:07 like we are pulling the data from data services which is one of them is ODC so it's not operational data store okay second thing I feel like you wanted to talk about the sequels are but you end up with talking as you sequel database so you cannot do Christmas Day when you saying that my source is on on Prem and then I'm pulling the data from on Prem when somebody ask you what is your on-prem TV answer is crossword clue sequel server maybe in our case you might want to say sequel server but you end up with saying that as your sequel DB which is not right because as your secrets or I just sequel server is basically Cloud one it's not a on Prem okay so keep I mean you know take care of that then your project explanation startup is good perfectly fine that is okay so that is you are ready with it then then I can probably have asked is about the challenging situation which you come up with the right only one thing which I would love would be is like you don't say how you did it until unless I asked so I asked so I want you to go on that that you said whatever was the problem you take a nap you set the stage video rightly then you leave it ideally rather than saying it like how you solve that let's wait for that question to come in okay then how you solve it so you just explain the problem and pause okay and let the interviewer ask okay then the third thing which we talked about is how you do the on-prem to the cloud right then you talked about okay we use a copy activity and then when I asked for and I ask it like only the top activity then you said about that we need to have you got a little bit fumble about about the integration run time okay so and then you talk about that we need a cell phone indication on time instead of that the auto integration and type but you are not very clear why we need the cell phone so the answer is like Auto integration on time is picking and calling it from random IP addresses so probably your private Network cannot get reached from add random IP addresses right because that is not something which is bind okay so probably that is probably your your private network will not allow to that connection to get Pastor because of your firewall and all and that's where we need a selfish indication on time so that I will be a fixed one which is connected to your database server because your database server is expecting a call from a limited IP addresses only and then yourself first and machine will get fixed and then that's IP address will be you know whitelisted by the firewall of your database server so that that connection get passed through so that is something which you need to work on you remember we have covered in our sessions okay so just go back to those questions and you know cover that the why we need the cell phone here instead of the your on Prem sorry for your auto resolve okay then we talked about your project okay then okay dad comes in and then how you going to you know how are you going to take the data forward after your lending data comes in probably at that piece ideally yes for the process maybe it's more of like either of you are copying into the bronze Lair via data breaks if you remember okay the project is not talking about is as you said as you mentioned it that it is something that you were talking about in the database side so your data is getting saved into the Browns player as a daily table but you creating those data table using the database right you create the bronze layer database and then you create your storing that translate tables as a brown Stables as a Delta table and under the hood table will get save as a parking lot you can go and do all that email operation generally normal operation is not allowed on normal spark tables but when you make a table as a Delta table then you can apply all that so then the floor is like from there once you get the data from your on-premise is there an 80s you go back to your databricks and from database you are fetching that you know tables and pushing it into using the mounting and all so I think that piece you got missed okay so just cover that up then when we talked about about this size of the data for your pipeline you said it like 5 GB initially then you get to the 0.5 GB you know so that is something which you know that's an expected question which you can always you know have a clear cut in the mind that what is the correct size okay so don't get confused between the 0.55 it was okay but why do you look very small so when you give me a very small thing you have to kiss Krystal pipeline per day something like that you getting my point so you have to Crystal Clear Define it so that eventually your number should look bigger the whole idea is that number should look bigger so rather than talking about less number try to talk about a bigger number okay and then from that you cut down to the lower number rather than take out on Lower number so you might start thinking about that one is my having a 100gb or like 100 times a pipeline in a month something like that over this is that the last week we talked about the spark optimization so for the spark optimization yeah I mean I understand you trying to talk about all those Concepts but I feel that it could be further more you know you should create a kind of a scenario and then talk about it because otherwise we will be very generous so maybe when I asked that okay you got to find it terabytes of 1 tablespoon or something like that then how you will optimize your this sparkle then you must come up with something like that okay so let's assume that on this a large database on largest generally whenever we have a small I mean when we have an arrow transformation problem does not happen so mostly this information you need to come in when we get into the kind of a white transformation so I assume that we have a lot of white transformation because of that probably this problem is coming up got it so that that's how you start up with and then you talk about it okay that will be a joint is there so now we might do a joint optimization so there could be a multiple ways in which we can do a joint optimization maybe we could do kind of repartition do using a bucket thing using something like software join or some different techniques right so that's how you slowly slowly progress it and then another good thing is that you are talking about the Delta tables okay so then there is a performance Automation in the Delta Lake of its own like you have an optimized Command right or you can run a vacuum command also which can also you know cut down some extra data which is not automatically you know delete it which is outside the retention period so all those things you keep in mind but I mean to to make your story looks more brighter if somebody is asking a very big question something like that tell me how you can optimize it so you can create a scenario around it okay so that your answer could looks more Justified okay so for example talk about the country now country is out of the scope right I mean so then you have to find your data set and then talk about the country okay so let's say for example and now let's say we are doing a joining around it so maybe we can partition the database on the country and then it will make sense to optimize it you're getting my point so that's how it's not that I mean bad but I feel like how you can make it more you know looks more better so that could be few points otherwise I will only trying too much digging into the project because a lot of people was wondering to check it like how the project think goes on so probably these points I think in the real interview maybe you not get too much dick down onto this project yeah I was purposely doing it so I hope you get you get the point like where you have to work on so yes you can connect another time after you prepare for all this and then we have a one more round of interview okay great I hope you enjoyed it and those who are watching this also enjoying and learn a lot thank you so much for coming on this see you soon love you

hi tripti hello sir good evening how are you today in biology but it will take a lot of time but in this I recognize that I can get a job at a very late period of time and the skills and the things that we are learning is really very nice and is really very interesting that's why I got interest in it sector and special in the data analysis field question about eligible for this field or not whether I can do here or not but once I started doing once I started learning things I thought that I am eligible and no such technical knowledge required in this field it is just our confidence and the and the courage to learn things that should be there inside someone tell me everything else education thank you for giving me this opportunity I have completed my schooling at kendriya vidyalaya gajapati coming to my educational qualifications I have completed my schooling that is my matriculation like Kendra video and then coming to class 11th and 12th that is my intermediate that also I have continued their at kendriya vidyalaya gajapati then I persuaded my graduation in bachelor in science biotechnology that I have done in bjb autonomous College bhubaneshwar then I did Internship for 5 minutes to interact with client and I make myself understand about the business requirements related to the data and I deal with server Excel and Tableau schedule oh nice the next one in 5 but I think you're done you know solid implementation in your project very nice to hear and also I didn't say that is also I didn't eat your project using all this stuff on Pizza Company on a pizza company extra cleaning process transformation and I analyzed many things how the sales on the particular company can be increased okay when do data collected what are the challenges you face and how to overcome the challenges while collecting data I faced many challenges like whether people did online transactions or offline transactions what they are doing how to deal with it took a lot of time lyrics the 70% work after that was nothing much more than that right on YouTube transformation like I didn't data filtration I have the weather today or duplicate values I have deleted all those things and I have transferred the that written record into some chats into tables into dashboards so that it will be easy for all to understand how the things are going on and I want to upload the data what analysis to do anything else is coming from multiple sources you extract in SQL query service online transaction is done how much email Amazon buying this how much mail customers are buying buying buying the kapisa and who are purchasing offline at what period of time the sale is high at what period of time the sale is low and I also analyze it which days of the week is the which days of the week is the more to like weekends on Saturday and Sunday people are buying more as compared to weekdays interesting how do you feel complexity like the business where do you feel that need to improve the data I don't need to improve the business in my opinions coming to myself I feel complexity through analysis and also data collection because sometimes I got confused what to do what not to do and that sometimes I get I got messed up how to do it and then I have to analyze many things I have to search more and more at that question I was little bit stuck up yes I overcome and it was interesting according to our convenience and according to a business requirements it is dependent on us how we are dealing with it what are the size of a data you did and the 10 call 8 to 10 columns this is very small amount of what is a school of work clothes there are so many operators some examples of greater than is equal to less than greater than equals to less than equal to in 19 like operator so what is you know Siri that is used to simplify simplify your query that is used what is the advantage that we have analyzed and we want to store it we can store it using view it is just for temporary use and we can create a view we can do analysis Rose from to to tables two or more tables there are four types of SQL joints they are in a joint outer joints that joint and cross joint out the joint is again divided into three types in or out in sorry right out the joint left out the joint and pull joints for experienced people what is the difference between relationship between 10 columns 3 normalization means it allows duplicate values what is the difference between diamonds and table is a table that stores diamonds and table is the tables that can be used only once like the fact table of fact table contains only quantitative value but diamonds and table does not contain 2030 value what are the type of transmission oil what is the time play Christina database schema information then we can use conditional formatting what is the maximum size 48,576 what is the difference Harry Potter there is a very minimum difference between report and dashboard because in while reporting also be represent data and in dashboard also be represent data only after analyzing the report data reporting means we are it contains data in a very windy summary way like it contains the report may contain data in written form in visualization form in graph form it can contain any form but coming to dashboard it is not attractive it is more easy to understand that you don't know how to replace a dashboard what are the steps when I collected data set I did a lot of work in data source Parts only like data cleaning almost 80% or 90% off worksheet and in Tableau worksheet I created many many graphs and also geographical graphs and after creating that I went to dashboard part and I created all those the the graphs I have created in tablet worksheet that I have put in a blue dashboard and I have sex for business requirements what is the difference between available in offline mode also but life I think it is not available offline it is only available online what is drill down in Tamil sorry that I don't remember what are the tablet product family can you be to elaborate please February reader www sorry I'm not able to do something what is your hobbies I love listening music what are you doing leaving teamwork I think I'm done with my brother do you have any questions for me anyways biologist

good afternoon how are you I said good afternoon I'm doing good how are you I'm good thank you tonight okay manufacturing raw materials which is used in almost all the sectors of the world manufacturers products for Airlines at manufactures products for agriculture 8 manufacturers raw materials for Cosmetics for clothing so it manufactures for electronics appliances so the raw materials which we produce in our company is used almost every appearance of the world how good are you approach is a chemical industry what is the use of for data generally technology we are manufactured the data and we sell the products to various end users who will use our raw materials and manufacture the end products so we sell the products so in my profile I do analysis of sales of those products in various regions of the world so I handle data globally for all the three reasons which includes Mr effect in your so I take care of the sales of those are products so I analyze the data for that okay now we understand that you are a product customer service good morning services and I am basically from north of India but I'm residing in Bangalore south of India from my school days so I have been graduated in Bachelors of Computer Applications from Indian Academy degree College which is also in Bangalore coming to my daily work tasks I log in and I open my emails I check on the requirements or any requests so I interact with the various business or stakeholders stakeholders clients and different managers of my organization to understand the data and the requirement and then I will start my analysis so I have expertise in Sequel I have worked with various joints in Sequel which includes left and I have also worked with various Clauses like we're closed having clothes Group by motorbike laws for filter the data which is required of based on the requirement of the client and I have worked with various aggregate functions in SQL also with the sequel so I have also good knowledge in Excel when I have worked with the we look up at 8:00 p.m. tables are creating charts and graphs so that it is I can communicate the data to the client or the stakeholders on my managers to have a better understanding and Make a Better Business decisions so I also have a very good knowledge in Tableau other visualization from various sources like it can be Excel it can be the CSV format or I can connect with the sequel so database to import the data and then I do my analysis and I do visualization and present data call and report it to my managers or my clients I also have basic knowledge in Python where can I have used a different Library like my network and I'm fine and pandas and whenever I have free time so I I I I I spent time in Reading magazine and I spend time in Reading newspapers and novels a lot of experience everything every day every minute is generated and it is we can information different pieces of data we can gather together and we can make a meaningful information out of it how to define the difference between data and information search data are chunks of details for example if I say if I say a pen it's a data if I say a mobile it's a data and when I say information so that is information never ever use data management concept can you give me a password where they start over the different application tools technique where you start and how will be you know implement this process serving the company is never managed data so I will initiate with Excel so that is a basic thing which everyone can adapt to or understand I will ask them to a like start working on Excel storing the data and then if they are okay then I will approach for equality use amount of data so that is a good option they can have and they can receive data based on they can provide access to people who can access what kind of data or information and then I also will advise them to you for a visualization purpose so that will give more better understanding of the data it will be easy for them to know how the company is performing and where they have to improve so these are the different also advised them to use Python for scientific or mathematical calculations to be done on particular data so yes sir these are my approaches to the company when you approaching this application process and when you were collecting stuff so the attributes what I would consider when it comes to a particular when I am aware of what do I connect for example I want to collect the customer information so I will be using the customer serial number is their names their first name their last name their mobile number addresses and if they are requesting existing customers I would like to know what products they are buying so I have a product column product ID column so these are like customer details what I would consider for customer information because they are for a customer point of view because they are very sensitive and also the bank information correct priority is Bank information so there are different kinds of joints in Sequel of which are used basically to join two or more tables there are two different types of joints are left joint or right joint out for joint okay so what is set operator what are the difference in similar to SQL joins the only difference is that set operators of different types of things what is group bypass and where you at the group message okay so goodbye is a function which we have in Sequel where we will it will help us to group a column having same values so whenever it is used with a sequel as select statements so whenever we want to have a count or we want to you know arranged a particular column which is having same values so we will use Group by from Junction sells I want to see the sales value okay by gender wise okay so do you want me to tell you something comma what is the dimensions of I am not which we have created or the dashboards what we have created in Excel and we can connect through slicer and we can view the database on our requirements creating calculator what is the difference between Dimension and measure in tablet set a Dimensions hold text values and measures for the quantitative values numbers what are the different types of available we have a string of Text data type we have date date and time Boolean values and geographical data types which is frequently used geographical how long do I have spent four years of my career in the same company I really like the work culture over here and that was the reason why I continue to hear the reason for my change is that I wanted to learn how to enhance my skills take new opportunities take new challenges in my career to understand various different tools used in different organizations so in general I wanted to improve myself both the technically and to to have a better sociality or expertise how do you spell experience so I consider that this role is perfect for me I'm sorry period so I can tell them that when I'm in notice there obviously I will tell them that I have got a better opportunity I will try to convince them and I will negotiate the wrong person that okay okay okay how do you say yourself in a more senior level yeah and I wanted to have interaction with more higher management involving in decision making of the company yes why are you very much and I am nice to meet you I'm very happy to connect with you so we feel positive and will continue for further step and I will get back do you have any questions for us I said there is only one question what I have is that what are the different or new projects which I would be working in in coming to 12 months of this company okay so this is the fastest internet

Alexa good afternoon how are you which part of India okay so what do you know about that you know our company you have any knowledge what do men would experience so we want to know more about your about your educational for the past 6 years I was in the data unless road so like basically at the beginning I was working in my company so it's my first company so I obviously I have like I have no much idea about how data is handling everything so what I did there was like I will be getting better so basically I'm not expecting data from there I used to get the data from the senior people like the singer whoever is doing that we have to first we have to find out what are the disparities what are the address and we have to gather the useful insights from the data site and then we will do the obvious inside and visualization I'll be back later that I already have currently and then we will be using so basically I use Excel and sequel for data analysis purpose and for visualization part I used a tablet so in my previous previous company also so there I have learned python like then I believe visualization for the table and probiotics nice looks like a very strong knowledge in data so what would you were using in your current organization the 2020 get that only a range of things only a particular thing but then I can add a condition there like Select Staff from the table where I can give a condition like employee salary greater than 1,000 or better than 5,000 like that so it's basically giving a condition to fill out our data what is your school concerned what are the different conditions and why you just Google Assistant to make sure that the unnecessary so we are basically trying to get some get some rules and regulations for example Google we are restricting the data not forget about it again yes yes yes yes Google so sometimes we might not be that the information that we need cannot be available in one table so we can connect the table with other tables and we can fetch date data so we have four different types of SQL joins so basically we have in the joint out the joint in the outer John we have three subdivisions like in the router so I left out the joint and the third set is we have Frozen What is the difference between a square and set up router so join basically give the results or some combination of 2 422 select queries you are more select queries what are the different set of operator available in Sequim unions and minus minus what is 2% * 12 and whenever you want to use that we can just simply call the procedure like execute and the procedure name so why using a suppository because obviously it will and it will really use the storage space and it's time it won't take much time you know if you are writing and it will take a lot of time so that I can hear me so you have a knowledge on a Microsoft Excel 1160 with the help of this Excel of the advanced Excel so it's like a it's a it's a common common most important and easy easy easy to use to it but it has some limitations like it cannot store more than 1000 data but other than that it's it's it's very useful what is the size of a data we can store in Microsoft Excel so it's available that column number comma then the sheet in which I want to do the look look up so we can select that entire sheet that will be the second value then the which column I want from the sheet that I'm looking for but she's not calling number comma is it like an exact value or I want the approximate value exactly I can give comma 04466 can you be to explain about production family what is the difference 13 130 I need to gather the information about the students so with the help of python I'm doing it I've done it so I use the I'll be getting something so for me I like to do that without which state or which country should I have more interested in online teaching or to learn coding any particular language recording we have not like that so I used to gather that data recorded according to the city wise or country Wise It's International right so like that then afterwards I used to do visualization I used I used to create boards so that you know we have the higher management teams who are not into technical people because they don't have time to check each and every detail in like the table or it's a bunch of data so to make them understand them into a very simple manner of that that is available at so beautiful yeah okay so what is your strength I would say I love learning new things so that's my strength improve my skills do you deal with the client what is your clients what are the requirements what exactly are the parents looking for so what type of the kids a different from others so for that purpose and then with the help of that we have we have a lot of lot of syllabus changes for the parents requirements and a 5 L of water container and neither one is marked aside from the total volume to measure the exactly 4 L of water we must utilize the container and the table in the right way how is this possible so first I will again take the little container and I will call you I will pull into my phone later container completely and now my phone later again I will fill my play the container pull into my little container so now again what I'll do is I'm going to take my flight container keep it into three so what I'll do is I will be already have a whole letter like to know like what responsibilities are you looking out for me as as your employee if I did also even though we are going for the next further down going for the director labor and client level is that they can they can explore and they can I know and then explain the details of whatever more and more you'll get to know ya make sense

YouTube YouTube do you have 40 years of experience in front and write 2.5 more than I thought I heard 4 years into three parts first part will be something question mark duct tape to tell the browser that which version of HTML we are using yeah that's correct and what is the use of ha what is the use of head of time headache attacks which are basically the title of the documents it can also include the external links like hours so I have one question for you what is the weather today #or in the body tag just before the closing body time the better place would be just before the body closing closing body time because we don't know what is written inside that script if it is like accessing the Dom elements and if we put it just before the body tag like in the head back won't be available there so it better to put just before so if I asked you to not put in the body type put it in the head like that and I like the code is accessing down elements okay yeah we can do that with the attribute to hold the Javascript file and execute after the Dome has been completed passing yeah so you're saying if we had different route in the while linking in the Scripture it will wait for the damn to be loaded right and then it'll execute yes so what is the difference if we added below if you had it below then also when the HTML is passed and is ready then it will execute music what is the main difference the difference is like it will download it is a better way so it'll be already downloaded by the time is remaining is being passed kind of battery is yeah yes there is also one attribute async attribute on the script that we can give yes how it is different from from different is like the downloading won't happen like just what we are like the difference if you don't have anything it will start downloading immediately if you don't have anything it will start downloading immediately and it will it will not pass the estimate if you don't add anything it will not go and pass the HTML till the script file is downloaded and executed so it will wait for the JavaScript to be downloaded and executed and then it will continue and pass the HTML if we had already discussed it will download it will start downloading but it will wait for the down to be ready to be passed yes but if we add a keyword what will happen it will start the downloading and it will start the password but it will not wait for the HTML to be completely passed it will wait only for the downloading of the Javascript file so as soon as Javascript file is downloaded and ready it will start the execution so in that time maybe half of the HTML is passed so at least it's downloaded it will start the execution it will pause like when it will start the execution it can do only one thing so it will pass HTML it will pause HTML passing and start yes we can say that and in this way it is very unpredictable like half of the HTML documents will be accessible half of the statements may not be accessible so it is very unpredictable things so we should not use that okay if if we know like it won't be accessing the door okay yeah if you don't know like if we if we know that it is not existing normal Elementary then it is the best and fastest way to do things so this is why it is available okay now there is one question what is like can we create any custom elements like your name is Avinash so can we create an HTML anything like with an Indian is it possible you can create anytime name you can create Avinash you can create anurag you can create any anytime it doesn't matter so now the question is like what will be the display value of the randomly created element the display by default all the elements are in line right so it should be in line that's correct and what is difference between the difference is the difference do the elements we can give margin left and right but we cannot give margin top and bottom to inline elements yes for log element we can give with the night every block element will start in the UI with the next line whatever wherever it is placed and it will take the width of its parent container by default if we are not giving any particular bits to the block and then we'll be taking the width of how much it required to render the content yes yeah that's true and what is like you told me we can we can give margin left and right but we cannot give up yes yes what about adding adding we can give to online elements okay so normally we give padding left and right elements height increases and width increases like if we give left and right then will increase and content will move left and right that box will move left and right based on the padding with so what will happen in this case will it move left and right with the inline elements will increase and yeah and top and bottom let's say we give only shift play property of images images are in line in line okay so on images images so they are not like that so we can give yes that's correct so there are two categories of in line elements do you know those two categories know I read somewhere like something replaceable I don't remember right now to categories come through some Source like image video iPhone and non replacement on those things we cannot give it to you okay so can you explain me what is Box model OKAY Box model is basically how the browser calculates the height and any element with including margin or border with the element height or weight or without including marginal border with basically it has two properties the content box and Border box in by default the content box is enabled in which like the height and width would not contain the margin and border of any element by water box that will be included while calculating the height and weight that's correct so do you think like Box model means all the elements are like box rectangular box does it have some something to you so so yeah all elements are like rectangular things right have you ever seen any element which does not have a rectangular shape rectangular or square shape L-shaped element only one element not two elements no no no no no no we can create a modification something but if we just give background like this okay so let's say we have one in Spanish okay and span tag is in such a way that we have put long paragraph which covers one line and half Line 1 1/2 line and if you give it a background color it will be like that right although it we cannot say it is perfectly fine because there will be one Gap but it is very weird shape it is not it does not follow the box like Box model properly so all in elements don't they do their own things okay okay all right so now let's move to JavaScript so what are different data types of primitive functions object like these okay so how do you use classes in JavaScript okay so you are afraid of classes so what is the type of that class with type of operator what is the time in JavaScript it will be okay and if you check the type of a function yes it will be objective okay if you check type of some array array will be objective okay you can start sharing your screen dial screen brightness is it visible you know not yet okay I don't know yeah this is is my screen visible he says I can you can you can zoom your PS code is it saying me function yeah so type of a function is function but function is not a data type in JavaScript Okay Google Edison function to yes class is behind the scenes is a function okay so okay let's come back to our service group can you tell me what are promises OK Google can you create a promise and resolved it when what time is clicked I have to create a promise and resolve it when a button is clicked button on our HTML elements can you repeat one more thing you have to create a promise which will be pending by default and I want you to create one button on the HTML on the page and that button is played that promise will be resolved and if you are using a wait then after I waited till then if you are using then then then call back will run so it should not resolved until that button is clear the promise I don't resolve rejected it it will be always impending state right and if I attach a document listener 2:30 you don't have to use like this you can try but our my promise to be resolved so you got it so much I promise it does not result it is coming from 16 and it is pending no no that should be resolved right and that should be resolved because you have resolved with a pending promise you have resolved a promise with another promise yes let me just reload once again whatever like online number just do control jet put put that selected thing in strings okay yeah now you can search you can play does not have to do anything with my promise yes because I have to so this is basically so but I have to find out how to This Promise let's just cancel this promise what is the state of this business you are DOT then whatever the promise will be resolved dot then automatically will be called yes it would eventually call a function that is all this promise can you promise you can like just one more minute simply call the first exactly okay so this will be resolved as soon as it is created right now right now as soon as it is created okay what about if we put that here and yes inside answer.com yes no add cash also okay dot catch on this and cancel this error also and create new change the name of this existing button and change its name to reject so there will be two buttons restaurant I guess this is good yes you can run it so this time reject the promise I want you to create promise you to have the functionality to resolve and reject okay yeah I think it is possible so first create a promise without using new promise I will you create create a promise yeah I have to check it later than Thursday I have to create sorry can you repeat that question yeah so the question is you have to create a promise without using new promise thing my function and sorry sorry just can you okay its okay so right now it is a promise with resolved so yeah so can you make it can you make it pending if you use it can I make it pending okay I'm also thinking operation is returning some value of a promise object but it is resolved with this value I have to make it ended first make it rejected first night how will you reject it it's forget about ending how should I rejected I can always throw an error yes but is the rejection so usually it will be pending if you use awake keyword and await keyword we can only use if we have a promise yes you got it so comment out the code which you have written about like I promise we have created just this is the promise object this will await for that to be resolved or rejected and and resolve it with your name like resolve it with your name first make it pending it should be pending for some time but you will resolve it not with the value of this promise but with a stream which is your name OK Google it will be pending until we click yes if you click on resolved I think we have you can you can do you can do resolved but we have not put any console log on resolving like this address is a promise so I have to no no no no I have to wrap inside another function and then call it function and then press will be consoled you can use like because of why because of the reason it is a promise is a promise I want you to use a way but don't create any function OK Google Perez you can use both places it doesn't OK Google we can use on top of and the top level bodies of modules I don't know the meaning of that so that second part is telling how you can use outside that way period models in JavaScript modules have you heard of that models we can like export and import which contains some kind of code how do you make a file model how do you make a 5245 what do you like by defining the type is equals to model year know exactly okay pause Netflix yeah okay the question is if we are using this awake keyword then the execution of that function is stopped right it will not continue yes it is so if that execution is stopped will it not block the main part of JavaScript execution is stop will it not block the main light because it is pushed in the call back and the main trade is empty or free to execute another functions from the call stack so let's say if my phone has 10 lines ok first four lines of the first first four lines of the function will be executed renovate keyword will come yes and execution will be stopped right yes yes you said that that function will go to the call like you or somewhere else and then promise it will execute some line from where it left so actually read that suspension thing after rejecting got rejection in the last 10 years old yeah but if you understand these things you will catch any problem very quickly so this is the thing with the functions the stop the execution and whenever that promises fulfilled that function will start executing from that line where it left and again if there is another event keyword it will do the same thing again and again yeah okay that's good now this was not machine coding ground we can say this is output this town but I did not send you any code Snippets now let's do some output place with module okay so I want you to create one more Javascript file console log something or something yes and some only one message yes no import this file in your website in in your main file no okay no in the Main Street yes you need to import it here what I would ask you to do is make a copy of this file and delete all the codes on this phone so that just for backup make a copy of a script just file so that it is available for your backup I want this file to be cleaned so just make a copy just to control me in the file expense that file file manager OK Google this is for your backup okay okay okay okay okay okay close this and clean this subscribe all right one first important that the script one file okay so what you have written only but we have not exported anything from here so you need to export some variable create some variable and exported yes so you can create sport script and one no cancel one more one more question like before this import line on like the right one more console just starting this Friday now I want you to get output what will come first login always on the top yes because we want to make things clear like flowers or nevertheless JavaScript do that okay I'm guessing here so this cancel you can check what is that is local news is not this index file is not right if you have written only script you need to add that extension and scripts OK Google how it is executing that line number before the start also okay so there are two phases first JavaScript would assign the memory do some all signing memory part and then the execution part sew in the first place is tends to collect all those things and yes period find me some number so in which school I want like the question is this word is going to which scope this word is going to which scope this would be in the global scope OK Google it is not a global ice we have seen it right so this is not a global what is happening here why do not a global oh this is generally the functional so it will be tomorrow yes in module we cannot first let's test statistic mode is working or not right so I'm not sure remove the wire and it will give up anything yet if you stick mode is not there it will not be there yeah so we I am guessing this answer please now so this belongs to the module not the normal JavaScript yeah so then we just hope it will go to it will not go to Global store this will go to this file scope scripture just file the model school yes model school there is something called Model school photo check that is very good things I have talked about okay okay so now let's come back to the school now now this is enough for this kind of output this question we can say that now I want you to know this is a machine on the screen you need to create a circle with random radio let's say let's say 10 to 100 pixel or we'll see how much we can give we can always customize that so they should be arranged so whenever you are clicks it will generate one Circle it will have only border it will not be filled and if you just again it will generate and if you just delete one time and when two circles are there we need to check if those two circles are intersecting each other or not you have 30 to 40 minutes of time okay just let me clarify that last part whenever the user clicks the third time and if two circles are there they both will be gone and another Circle will come yes exactly and what about the intersecting part so first week we will click on Circle will come Yes again we will click some somewhere else right here and then another smaller like very small and away from the first Circle so it will not touch the other side because we are generating random songs random radio so the question is you need to find out if that is intersecting or not okay and if normally what I should cancel it yeah you can cancel like intersecting and if you want you can also mention that how many pixels it is overlapping that is option part if you just so it is intersecting that is more than enough lyrics you have like 45 minutes you can take even more time just one last question okay I'm thinking about the approach of creating the circle just help me with that I am I will be creating a deal with some random width and then giving the battery is radius 50% to it yes that would be good okay so you can use this light on snow that would be good to give me the X and Y coordinates of the click okay okay okay okay okay what is the address that you will remember everything OK Google the radius means the half with should be a random number I don't know how to fix the minimum value of the random I generally don't you cannot fix you have to write some code to do it you have to do some calculation will always give number between 0 to 1 okay okay so the random number will always give me 0 and 1 between 0 and 1 1/11 make it 50% of create an element cost of a circle document dot create and then okay if maybe set up what is the border the radius to 50% and okay and assembly offended circle into the body and know I have two minutes to take time to consideration right now like 9:17 time is you have time to next time to 10:10 p.m. okay can I Google these types of things like you can you can you can Google 8 + 6 + 65086 okay I am I have to sign everything right at this time property with to be how to make it two times what is franchise estimated development not open child Circle skip skip okay I should give border color but I should find our Circle this is here I can give order color to it right a little bit of Define way and then pixel then pixels top is that why and left it yes it is not putting it in Center because I have two - 100 what is the value of y or less twice 2:58 and I'm okay yes okay first part is done but whenever the 30th happens I have to check if there are more than two elements on this screen more than two times and I have to remove the child just how I want one thing I wanted to ask can I remove all the elements at once or should I just use the forage Loop you can like it doesn't matter anymore ok Google and then I should create the third so those are going to be created and then this will be removed let's take one two three one two three four h we cannot use because of this notary and we cannot use for which we should we can use storage 1 2 and 3 okay second part is done the only part is we have to cancel if the second circle is intersecting intersecting with the first one and the one more part the random let's first check intersection OK Google Eddie where are you going to be storing a starting or the coordinates of each and every Circle and create it and if both are intersecting I just have to cancel it after opening the child we can unlock the second circle of the x coordinate anywhere between x + 50 or x - 50 it would be interesting with the x-axis or if it is -50x I just want a diaper first and second first Circle 0 does excellent okay I cannot do that okay I can do that this thing because first of all can you explain me what you are trying to find out so that I can okay what time do I'm trying to do is since I have to fix the radius of 100 pics of I am storing the x and y coordinate of both the circles and I would be like checking if X1 is in the reference of X2 then our x coordinate is intersecting like if x 1 minus x 1 + 30 + is in between X2 range then it will be interesting with x coordinate and same goes for the white coordinate know like how will you check that how will you check both or needs and differently because it is a circle okay it is not a square so okay if it is it was a square you can check in that way Circle okay OK Google Turkish lots of nuts intersection coordinates where it is intersecting yes yes turn on Gates lyrics but you need to explain to find out square root of the sum of a square of its arguments okay and if this distance and this distance is less than the sum of the radius then it is intersecting and is the distance between the white coordinate is this write in such a way that both intersect let's see if okay and if the sum of the radius is greater than or equal to the radius we can see that in the sum of the radius is greater than the X then it's is not intersecting is less than one minute how should I tell you like you can just move your house I think in Microsoft teams does it take a whiteboard I don't know if you can just draw it doesn't matter okay okay I suppose we have two circles here right with some radius actually we have the same radius but suppose we have the different radius on the same time so that is extra means taking the difference the distance between these two centers of the x coordinate right no it is not doing that it is doing something else it is I like √10 so obviously if the radius is lesser than the distance between the x coordinate this would not be intersecting as I can we can see here and same goes for the second part where both will be aligned vertically right yeah but it can like it can be it will not always be either vertically or horizontally yes it can be anywhere yes suppose we have like this like so when we use this thing is 0 - 61 and 50 - 511 and then we calculate the energy right angle triangle right then we can hypotenuse this would be the best distance right yes and then again we are coming we came back to that same problem the sum of the radius and the distance between the centers yes exactly so basically this thing that hypotenuse and we are doing x - 0 - 61 and Y 0 - 51 yes it is calculating the distance between two parties this is the first thing is first half of the right angle triangle second when is like when is height when it when is base and does hypotenuse will calculate the hypotenuse which will be the actual distance between coordinates yes and if the distance is less than the sum of radius which means it is intersecting if distance is less distance you can record I'm just making it prepared for the random thing if I can do that too okay and if something is true OK Google text to Y2 X11 X2 X11 X2 Y2 R1 is 50 This Is 50 oh let's leave again intersecting is false and if I just click it here intersecting is true I have 10 more minutes late -123 / 2 and Max and men are sorry 200 okay let's see suppose we have 29.14 it will give us 23 always okay so if we give at this this will always give me these two numbers 50 506 we just have to find the other one for circle with the variable is radius yes and we just started to and second service and we should provide is r155 it is not drawing or this is the circle two by two okay but we have seen here like 2 * 277 short floor mat dot OK Google it is coming but it is coming with this radius it is radius okay but height and weight is if you check in the Styles go back in the room this is not the picture yes ok Google it came true because okay we have fluids that's why no no no no no what is my radius 79 186 okay there is something else you can see can you see anything that is the problem it should not be only radius radius into two it should be radius into two okay yes because we have time we should keep radius we should not divided by 2 * 2.00 x and y coordinate yes so we should be exactly like if we miss it it will subtract less okay so if we and then subtract it then it would be missed some floating Point numbers no not floating like half of that it will it will not do the proper calculator and yes now the last thing let's let's see and test yeah that is 10 Let's test one more time it is very good play it is very good to test it yes yes what let's say put if you put one circle inside light it is not intersecting but it is still saying intersecting yes Google just checking the distance we are always assuming that others outside yes yes yes yes yes so this case you need to fix it so you can do it later but whatever the task force you can stop sharing your screen and yes let's come to the final discussion part so it was kind of interesting yeah so how like how many points will you give you yourself for this interview I sold the last bottle so 7 would be good so you get 986% generally use at my place if I get stuck anywhere so I would say this is the best interview I have taken so far one more interview I took that was also good that isn't like he also had 1.5 years of experience but I did not go into this step for for that person but this is very good interview I have taken so far one of the best no no it was really good I keep on watching your videos and I was expecting some more questions from CSS as I have seen your videos from the interview ones but didn't get that I did so that's why you were able to answer that one in line like yes yes I guess so but you always tell student to go and learn more why is it happening so yeah I go on the internet I learned it I forgot The Replacements what is it is called if you know the thing that it is there something like this to categories that is more than enough and it's very good like one thing that you can improve is it is very much you can give full name satellite short names for it it is okay for interview because you have to be fast you have to do the work still not bad name so for example coordinate instead of writing whole coordinate to c o o r that for interview is good but if you are working just give full name and it doesn't matter you can give one name that does not that is okay that is describing the thing okay so I wanted to ask Google 30 made one video but it is not published yet it will be going live in like 3-4 days so like I was to and not watched I have made one video but it is just a story you you haven't watched that video like my story video How I Learned and from farmer to software engineer yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes I did not talk about which YouTube channel I followed how I learned all the things but that that video I have recorded it will come back to still have learned from all the places where you have learned like monster from some people but through the code while writing the code I learned a lot and assess any cold steel and what's the assist Kevin Powell and like self-exploration just explore in the dev tools how things are working reading MTN that's all okay okay okay okay okay okay okay another question this is such an extent as I know something else so I will teach back in only if I know to this extent so that's why many people are requesting me to make a video on notice and I am not making because if I teach it it will be like any other course but I want to teach it in such a way that nobody has started before so I want to master it the way I know something I'm not able to give time every day consistently still I will learn any other questions Bosch

good afternoon thank you how about you I'm good thank you I was sick I was going your profile okay so I feel impressed show me and the team want to understand more about your profile for Christmas 2015 so I currently work at 10 work at an organization called the business research company near my daily tasks involved communicating and interacting with client stakeholders and different managers manager of different team to understand the business requirement related to data I am very much in Microsoft SQL Server where I extract and manipulate data using various SQL functions like joints set operators ranking functions and complex SQL queries I have good knowledge in Microsoft Excel filters data validation conditional formatting I have used a various Excel formulas like we look up all the text function play my functions and also I did some a dashboards and reports using Microsoft Ms Excel I am working knowledge in a database relation tools like a tableau wherein I have created various reports and dashboard and have shared across the teams are the concerns I have good knowledge in Python has been like in the fields of in the like I have good understanding about the library of python like number apart from this I do have some good understanding on the data governance and data Quality Concepts so this was in for me thank you did thank you tell me what is data governance so like a based on a certain criteria like only a few people can view the data so data governance team will be deciding that what is the data quality so it is checking and maintaining the quality of data like we might have some lubricate values to duplicate data duplicate records and like some instances of should be changed and there are many things I just spoke and give an example of two things here why is it important to any business in India or maybe yes sir it is a really important for any organization across across the world because data breaching has become a great concern these days if the customer data are employed data is easily accessible to any other people so there might be many problems so if you have a good data governance for a company so the data will be within the company within the organization and it will not be available to who are like The Outsiders so amazing maintaining privacy of day of customers or clients or even employees very much important these days so I feel that data governance is very much important for any organization yes so that's okay never ever use data management data management in the foundation for any any other business correct know the business is growing their expanding the car manufacturing and business so you are going to hire the first person in data management team search the company that these all things have to be reported in order to have a future reference I mean if we want to grow the business further in the coming days so if you understand the customer service so I'll spin the company that in order to come up with those strategies firstly we need to have a base and this can be done by having the date of the customers so even the feedback system is very much important then only we can improve our product quality and we can come up with different products so I will clearly explain the company that these are the important like I will highlight the importance of data management so and I'll try to look out for people who are having certain skills in the market what do you do exactly in your company yes so basically here like we will be catching the data and we'll maintain the database so whenever the different teams like for the recent project was about financial database management so we had we had to capture the financial parts of a various companies we had a list of around $500 companies so we have to capture all the records of the all the financial data of that companies into a certain database so after that we had some we have different teams here apart from the data analysis we have the reports are teams are greatly we have like the field so they'll be asking for a data they'll be asking us the required data So based on that requirements will be extracting the day and we'll be sending it to the Consulate in customers everything might be going smooth but there will be definitely a case in anyone's life like they'll be certain things are challenges so firstly without panicking I'll try to understand like we are doing the start daily but they said this particular day if I got some issue in this I'll try to understand what what are the things that went wrong so I'll take I'll take like five minutes on it I'll try to understand what is the actual gap between the I mean the actual are and I'll try to rectify myself if I'm still not clear about it I'll try to interact with my team and internet with my manager so finally having a clear understanding on it I'll just check the all this queries or the work which I have that so I'll try to do it like that okay I'm doing a scenario you're working your clients okay that asked for SLA what is it a service level you must have to provide the service is very very important and they are expecting the same time at the same time so I'll try to explain the same that I will put them on the mail to my manager to the director no pleasing way so I'll explain everything at 11:00 p.m. to your manager OK Google so still I feel that like I might be wrong but then the next day morning I might be like pointed out on it but I still feel that client is someone are generating Revenue so the first priority should be given to the client so I'll try to do it quickly and what the task is giving by internal stakeholder directors is going to leave yes so it depends on the like my question I think you were not here if I if I like delay the report and the next working day would be having some okay sounds good so you have looks like a very strong knowledge what is a school Windows function can you explain the beautiful records in a partition or in a table so under Windows functioning we have four different things so one is a room number and second one is Rank and then Frank and the entire number what happens is a unique number will be assigned to each phone inside a partition in the number will be assigned a partition but it keeps the similar values so and in Denver and each it is the same I mean a number will be assigned to each I can give you a good example of Benchmark is like a generally the state government how it gives the ranks to liquor people I mean at the students they followed it and concept and coming to entire based on the input which we give it will divide the it will divide a complete data into sudden partitions for example in entirely if you are giving it has three so if you have 30 report it will equally divided into 1080 equals that is 3 part in each partition it will say no particular number for the reports okay so what is the school set up and what are the prices set operator is basically used to combine two or more select statements and like that there are four different types union union hall intersect and except soil in Union what happens it it will combine both the tables I mean both the select statements and the only combined the it will leave the duplicate things I mean the common things will be removed and in Union Hall it will combine the two sell statement including everything it even includes the duplicate values and intersect only the common things will be joined and in except from the first table only the first table I mean first select statement records will be displayed that to it will explode the common things from the second statement this is how we use that okay that's what is a school joints and what are the school joints yes Joanne is basically used to combine two or more tables in SQL so there are four different types of joints mainly which is nothing but a cell phone and again we have three different categories like left Giant and full joint so basically do you want me to elaborate these things again sorry rules on our data I mean it will restart the different types of constraints are primary key a unique default not and check if if I have to give you an example if I take an example of not know if the end user is entering some null value in that particular column it will just show another it will not take it because we have already defined a kept a rule for that particular problem so concerns are used to restrict the like Direction the customer is using entering some incorrect data how much your comfort zone here I am quite comfortable how how it depends on like a daily basis the major function the major job is like Gathering the day and managing it so based on the change requirement for the stakeholders requirement we do sometimes a daily basis mostly sometimes one or two days we might have another or some other tasks so in a week around 3 days we will be definitely working on writing quotes and Nots how you optimize what is a School images what I understand so that it looks good and it also like when we are sharing the data also when we are sharing the code is necessary so it looks good so firstly I'll try to understand the requirement and after that I have a code for myself I mean I'll write a code very I will understand the requirement I'll check if I'm getting the correct output or not then after that I will try to this would be even more minimize so I'll do that okay great do you have to pay for everything and you want to build a rapport 16 chat box so do you want me to like create a table for us or Joy I just want to get the data from 2: 1 between drop and I want to delete a particular column from a table OK Google and the column name was cities perfect okay what is the fact that everyone can you explain what is practical and dimensions in fact table we have the description family something like that primary key of the dimension table and dimension table we have the description about the fact table so this can be actually classified into three different types so one can just ask him up and second one is too much we will be having we will be having the it is like a primary care of the dimensions for example if a company there's a company called XYZ company so it will be it will be having a fact table and under this fact table there are different Departments of this particular family like HR Finance Marketing sales all these the date of all these particular departments will be becoming the dimension tables what is normalization and denomination is like normally in the data for example a data in a particular column there might be the data should be entered in only two particular things like I'm just giving you an example if it is male and female but if someone has entered instead of mail if someone has ended in there so they don't know it's nothing but keeping a specific like a standard and according to that standard we are cleaning the data that is what I understand from the term normalization yesterday I want to do if you want me to explain on it like will be initially capturing the financial of financials of various companies into Excel so here we are after capturing they'll be like it will be used in Excel and after capturing will be checking for any like when with the cleaning data and cleaning and transforming it so after transforming it I mean after a they will transfer it into SQL and there if we will transforming it I mean by sending it to SPN will try to see if it requires any other further modifications as such and I will be like extracting the data into ESPN and here will be maintaining the databases so already we have certain databases so we'll see we'll check if we in the data has to be entered into that particular database or if we have to create a different database for these set of companies because you're on here will be changing the I am here the date will be recorded right so please check into which state and will be keeping it there and after that after loading it to the final two there so what we do is like a bill will be maintaining it based on the requirement will be sending the data whenever needed and also will be creating certain reports and dashboards even this thing comes when the when the manager of other teams are asking us coming to us there if you want they want to check the company company performance of insert and industry or certain top company performance last year so we will be creating a reports and dashboards using a tablet here sometimes we do it Excel do we do in Excel and sometimes we do it and so it is a combination of both and we create certain reports and we will be sending it to the consent people do you have experience in yes I have like not much answer I use like a number of pandas and my lovely okay what is it what is the difference between I have some understanding but I'm actually working on it so if given some time I'll definitely manageable 84 be like a tablet desktop or Tableau public server and liquor there are two other things but 99% of the work is done in tablet desktop like we will do on the development related things and interior 1% period okay you do customize in a tableau sequel code can you tell me about customer support 8 * 8 I don't have any issue with the word but as you know like to have a financial group like I am I have certain commitments in my personal life so I'm looking for some Financial Group and stability so that is the reason I'm looking for a job change you tell me what is so basically I'm gone so I believe that I have some good knowledge particular areas and I'm also cleaner so if any other tools are required turn on Bluetooth so I believe that I'll be a contributing towards the lake in the voice of the company quickly so I feel that I am a good fit for this particular words what is your restraint sir my friends are like as I told one of the one of the things even under like when the task is deadlines for the task so we will be communicating with the team be working at home around 8 people so we will be coming and will be dividing the work quickly and we will be working on it so I would say that ok Google Shut Up Liquor the discussion was like really good and I like to know like if everything goes fine and like when can I join the company yesterday

good afternoon sir yes sir okay tell me something about you I have completed my schooling from Saint Mary's secondary school with the score of 8.667 of 76.54 + 18.00 + Baba and I am really I mean I'm really fond of WhatsApp and augmented reality therefore I have worked on you later today for platform and I worked on several projects and that's a lot that's all about me thank you anything anything more I mean you can adapt in any situation you can you can change yourself I would not be having my parents that time I have to do everything on my own so that would be completely different environment for me so yeah that would I have to adapt in that situation in these past couple of months discovered during the pandemic we don't have so much pressure and it gives us time to explore us more to explore more opportunities for us so yeah that is good okay yeah what about what do you know about the company get your group can you tell me in 5 sentences with nobody have spoken remarkable company and it has I mean gateway gateway of the most educational right now what are the new technologies that they have introduced in their companies the campus introduced and the campus is what they are doing for 2021 basis for another batches this is also coming under the university program yes it is a part of the program technology everybody is saying that it is a great group of company I think interacting with the mean teachers and Teachers Association I mean several applications like WhatsApp and FaceTime apps are there so we can do that is not one of the major Concepts okay nice talking to you Google thank you this is your first interview you have participated in the morning how was the experience of this month what is the difference 724 maximum after 5 years ok partner what do you mean by that the company would have engaged with many countries and digitally and they would have introduced themselves in another companies about what the work they are doing and what the part they are playing in the company full stop set in the presentation that they're also working on your Technologies as our and we are I think that that would really help me to learn more about my technology which I really am really interested in so I think that would be the major growth of myself and what will be your contribution that I would be learning I would be developing and learning in the live projects and yeah that would be my contribution what are your qualities which you think will help the company and resilient punctual strong leadership qualities management Etc okay what are you going today question mark baby people from different parts of the country maybe different part of the globe also can you do then enjoy your work and how would you know it's not like that I mean I can make friends I have that ability and it's a it's like it's my choice of completely on them so it's not working it's not difficult so I'm not for me I can adapt to situation so I can adapt to new people as well nice talking to you all the best English these are to learn more languages so I can learn and I really want to learn and grow right now so you are waiting for getting a job and you will learn according to that job Department about different Technologies can you tell me what are the difference how can you use the card number for using car dealers also no song I mean we just have to use the awt components to set up in the layout and what is the difference between 1 minute no but nowadays we are using swing components this is no idea can you briefly explain the life cycle of multiplication multiple operations and if operation is taking too long to perform then we shift that to the concurrent heads are executing at the same time are you sure that they are concerned at the same time What is the difference between a single processor system is executing simultaneously I'm asking about multiple times sorry it has different I mean it has some it is a process and it has multiple threads and execution running at the same time or the second and third is waiting for the first to get complete then 30 is waiting for second to complete or any wrongdoing scheduling is applied yes or no they are not waiting that one would be completed device what about the database are you familiar with the database or select star no no no no no selects the age from the table name where we have to duplicate select select start from tables where the ascending and in bracket The Edge so jdbc Drive new features so I think that is basically the I mean development deployment and debugging part that has been introduced debugging part is already there no I mean you are version of people Google OK Google and if anything I think from that was that if you wanted to give any more minutes OK Google

okay so before going to start let me just give you a few instructions and then we will start okay so this is going to be walking to you and which is also will be recorded and will be uploaded on YouTube later and because others also learn something from it and the second thing is and don't be nervous and be confident okay and yeah so let's start with this are you okay with that yes are you fine okay great so based on your profile I have just consider your profile as a fresher okay and also mentions skills like manual testing and then I will write these are the basic three different skill set to mention your resume so let me ask some basic questions because I consider your profile as a fresher so let me just go with some basic questions right okay so shall we start now yes so can you just introduce yourself what is your experience and qualification what is your skill set myself niharika I'm basically I have completed my VTech in computer science in Italian Institute of Technology of 6065 and coming to my house so what do you know about sdlc software development life cycle Fallout 4 developing a new software okay and what are the different phases of including sdlc the face requirement Gathering requirement Gathering analysis design coding testing installation and maintenance support comes in this face 18 will be there with the business analyst along with the design Architects along with the Architects HR and the finance team where they will do the feasibility study of the technical feasibility study resource feasibility study as well as the finance feasibility study after after they do the once the feasibility study is done here the project manager will decide whether to take up this project or not based on the requirements and after after taking up the project the next process is the design phase here the senior Architects just tell me just very high level action so I don't need any internal what are the task will be done so what exactly happening the requirement what will happen in the design and coding testing and so let's say in the requirement analysis space mainly business unit project managers or product managers these people will be involved and during the day the design and development so development people will involve so they do some kind of design like high level design low level design and accordingly they like the code during the coding phase and then testing will come into picture and after completion of the testing so then we'll production will start okay so this is very high level information about sdlc you know need to go in detail of sdlc until until unless I ask the question okay if anybody asks you explain in detail about is you need to explain what are each and every activity will be done in the stairs okay so what do you know about sdlc so do you know about STLCC sdlc what is the steel it is a software testing life cycle okay it is a process which is following processes talking about enters software development process from the requirement to deal production but is a part of development process so sorry part of testing process okay it is talking about only testing phase like during testing what you do we will understand the requirements right and then we will write the best case that's part of Designing and then we will execute the test cases and then finally we will get from the test and we will report to the developer so these are all activities during STLCC process there's a part of enter is deals okay great so do you know what are the different models are available or what is DLC like software development process models what are the different models are available so do you know about remodel okay so how the development and testing activities we will do the functional testing but initial levels like in the requirement play some design phase how the testing will happen in the model we will review the documents so static testing is done so what is static testing testing any software based on the documents is called husband of testing right but in the face of requirement analysis or designing by the time we don't have any software only we have to talk about so by the time you don't have any software to be ready until next time software is not ready right so during requirement it is unfair so we will review the document we will test the documentation like the documentation means what the documents again talk about the software how it will be what are the different features should be there right so we will verify whether the documents are currently return or not completed or not so that is comes under static testing because we are going to test only documentation part until unless the software is ready right once the software is ready once the development is started then software will be ready then we do Dynamic test so there we will exactly test the software okay so that's the basic difference so in the Border like a development and testing will happen early like a while development is doing unit testing a unit like development is happening you need testing will be done so integration testing and then system testing and you editing so these tests will happen depends on the responding documents like we have SRS document like we have a design document then we have a unit test plan then we have integration test plan right so System test on those documents we will perform the testing in the world okay so do you know about anything of functional testing what is functional testing functional testing what is testing the functionality of the behavior of an software okay so Suppose there is an application so how we will start functional testing how will perform functional testing Suppose there is no problem so there is an application and you have to start functional testing on the application so how we will start what is your approach how do you perform functionality so we we will start and what you will refer before connecting functional testing because right for we cannot directly start functioning right if you want to test in application you have to know something you need to have you need to know something about application right until unless you know that application you cannot directly start testing right so how do you perform functional testing so how we will start first 30 will be done after we will prepare the test data for the input so will you prepare test cases first or test date of first kisses the functionality right once you understand the functionality then you start creating the test cases and if there is any data is required for the test cases then you will prepare test cases okay all right so the next question is a suppose I have given an application and you who is that application but I have not provided to you any documentation so you don't have any documentation by hand I was right for I have given an application so how to test that application what kind of testing you will do we will do the exploratory testing we will explore the application by using the application and we will get to know the functionalities means without having any documentation so we will just explore the functionality it's basically learning the application and then we will start testing okay so what is regression testing testing testing testing the modules the modified models and also if there is any if there is any changes because of because of the change in one model whether it is affecting the other models are not we are testing that in the regression testing okay great so sometimes the developer made some changes in the bill so because of those changes the existing functionality or some other functionality we should not be impacted by the changes right so sometimes developer may add a new functionality or they will fix existing box right so because of that they do some kind of code changes and that should not be impacted another functionality for that we will test the existing functionality also along with the new feature and back fixes so there's a command center regression testing so perfect okay so how to write a test case so what you will refer like the test case so what is the input for so let's say you have a project okay and suppose to write some test cases and what is the information you need to have before getting the test cases what you should know so you have to know the requirements yes you need to know the requirements and where you will get the requirement where you will understand the functionality of our application until unless you know the functionality you cannot write the test cases right so where exactly will get the function where you will know the functionality on what basis you will understand the functionality using the scenarios yes yes we will prepare the test because you have to write even if you want to write so you need to know something right you need to know the function of application so we can see the functionality how we will know the functionality of application in the SSundee SRS means a software requirements specification and functions specification requirement which is contains a detailed documentation which is in understandable format more clinical format and testers developers will able to understand okay that's all if far is functional requirements specification document based on that you can understand and if it is also sometime contains the use cases I use cases what is the use case do you know what is a use case is also part of a requirement by seeing the use case you will understand what is the input what is an action what is an outcome so you will review all these things and depends on that or based on that you will understand the functionality and then you will form the test scenarios and then you later test cases okay that's a process is there any difference between what is the difference between test cases is the indeed documentation talk about how to test like what are the different steps are involved what is an expected what is an actual result so these things are included in the test case the best attraction which we need to perform on the application and then we will check the expected and actually is exactly equal or not so those things will be included in the test but test is very high level against we can divide it into multiple test cases so what is can have one or multiple test cases okay great so good answer and let me ask if you want more questions what is the difference between priority oh priority is is the urgency of fixing The Defector reality is the how much impact it is it is on the business okay business of the customer okay so see what is basically talking about the seriousness of the defect how it will impact the business right and priority is nothing but how soon we need to fix that issue is basically talking about the time okay good okay so what is the defect life cycle can you explain the difference make the sign and once it is assigned they will develop developer will fix the defect and it will be assigned like after fixing it will be your status has it fixed and they will send it send back to the test for testing then test this effect and if it is a fixed then he will close the defect and if it is not it fixed then he will send it so do you know about agile process and Basics is there any advantage when you compare with other Motors one day of agile process original model process the communication in the team is good the communication will be good and also here there will be a less documentation documentation of that we can provide the delivery soon and quality will be good okay so in agile process so customer no need to wait till the long time okay so he will get the very frequent releases let's say there is a huge functionality is 10028 for all 100 ft to be completed as soon as we completed some piece of software we will test it and we will give the demo to the customer and if he's okay we will release that piece of software to the customer and finally he is using it and on top of that we will have three more features and again we will start and testing process so customer is mainly no need to wait for long term to dentist office so we can deliver a piece of software in intervals okay that's the main advantage of aging process okay great so let me just give you one scenario so I can just tell me how we can test it and let's say in Internet banking applications you want to send a money to some other person so we need to provide you need to enter some memo right so that I should be limited per day let's say you can send out between 20 and 10,000 maximum 50,000 so you cannot send more than 50,000 so starting like 10,000 minimum amount maximum amount 50,000 you can send per day okay so how we can test how we can test that field we can test this by applying the testing techniques analysis okay okay so how we will test it by using BBA mobile analysis yeah we will check with we will check with the minimum what is the 10,000 and and 10000 - 1/6 and 10000 + 1 will be checking for these three letters for the minimum and when it comes to the maximum again we will check with the maximum that is a 5000 and we will check for the 50,000 - 1 and 50,000 + 1 so we have to check 6 mm that will cover all the boundaries okay now let me let me just give one scenario so I need to upload a file in my application I need to upload a file and that's basically an image file okay so that is accepting only dot PNG file and the size of the maximum size of the file is one MB so I should download only one name is one named B and that should be dot PNG exchange so it should not allow any other extension or it should not allow if the size is exceeded one empty so can you just give me one to test case and one negative test case for this do you know what is positive test and negative test is positive testing negative test case or testing okay so first let me tell me what is positive testing testing a software by passing the valid input according to the customer requirements so that is positive and negative is passing the invalid the input which is not according to the customer requirements right so now just tell me one positive and negative test case for file upload so my requirement is file share should be back from one named it should not exceed and always file extension should be dot PNG it should not accept any other extension of the fights now tell me one positive test and one negative test case for that the image should be should be in the format of the so that is what is the positive and negative is we are to check to check that the size of the image is greater than 1 MB okay so that is a negative and also we can also check the extension right if you upload file with less than one number successfully if you upload the file get that one is native to similarly the extension if you upload the file with the uploaded with without testing so can I ask some questions from java I think you are still on Java I'll ask some basic questions okay and yeah so you are already mentioned your profile you know some Concepts support object oriented programming Concepts so can you just let me know what are the oops concepts are supported by Java yeah and capsulation okay and what else what about the class objective so the first one glass of red apps so these are all different object-oriented programming Concepts okay so can you just tell me the difference between method overloading and overriding overloading and overriding it should have in the method the parameters should be of the Justin Bieber first of all what is overloading what is is the two parameters we cannot create again but if you still created two parameters again we need to change the data type or order of the parameters so each and every method should have a different definition you should not be a unique that's called method overloading so when you come to overriding sew in method of riding is Possible only with inheritance at least we need to have a two classes right that means whatever method we created in the parent class the same method if you recreate again in the change class by changing the implementation which is basically called as over already right so overloading is possible with single crochet is Possible only with inheritance at least we need to have two classes then overhead is possible but in overloading we will change the only parameters method name is riding we should not change the definition didn't type name of the method number of parameter we should not change we should change only the implementation so these are the basic differences between overloading and overriding what is the use of a Super Kmart when do you use super keyboard in Java how are you okay no problem you created one method and in the sales last you overrated that method okay now when you create an object of the jail class when you call that method only method will be called because there's a latest matter you have implemented but still if you want in the immediate parent class method yeah right so then we will use a super cute like we can invoke the immediate parents we use super cute he is basically used along with the inheritance concept okay so what is an abstract method in Java what is an abstract matter which doesn't have the complete complete implementation so that method is called right so the matter doesn't have any implementation just only if you have only definition which is called as abstract matter so where we can create abstract methods in Java where you can create normal class can can I can I create abstract methods in a normal class so maybe we can create yes interfaces we cannot we can create abstract class and where else what else where else we can create abstract class right so we have an abstract class if you are so even interface also we can create an abstract methods and those methods we will Implement later by using some other class okay so in interface implementation is not possible so we need to create another class and then we will Implement those abstract matters so any idea about collections do you know anything any collections like a list of hash map okay no problem okay so let me ask a few questions from SQL so do you know SQL so how much rating you can give on a scale 1 to 10 5:00 so let me just ask if you guys because you mentioned like you have knowledge on South Koreans and joints and you know some basic card email commands a simple way I'm going to ask let's say I have a product table if you have a paper and then you can just write it down or if you have a notepad is still you can write it down no problem going to show you simple a product table which contains only two columns okay and product name or the other column is a price product and price only two columns one calling me is having product name and other call is called Product price so there are different products so some products are having same Price Rite some products are having a higher price on products are having low price so I want to display the data from the stable like expensive products like whichever the product is very expensive I want to display the data of that particular product they have 10 items in your table each item is having some price let's say one item is 100 rupees other item is 200 rupees or 500 rupees or 1000 now I want to display the item which is having highest price or which is very expensive single table only two columns select OK Google how to get most expensive product or high value product and the product which is having high price and you compare with the rest of the products okay then select the product name from the products table where Max or Max of the product price Max function how to use this Max function can we write can you achieve this with single or do we need any support for that we need we need some product right now what is my requirement yeah I want to just display the details of the product not only Magnum yes so that we will get the maximum price and that is the subway subway equal to in the South Korea's of fries from the products table so first we need to know what is a maximum price right what's the highest price in the table and once you get it we will use the maximum price and then get the details of the product which your products are having that price we will get it so select mags price from the product table is a and the output from the query will be the input of the outer body so in order for we will justify the selectors table or select the product name or price from product so we cannot do this by using Safari right okay so can I ask one more question so it's a simple having customer service customer ID is a customer named and our customers are belongs to different countries like one customer is belongs to UK us or any other countries now I want to face the data from this table like each country how many customers are there so let's say I have a table in which there are five different customers are from US country right so now I want to find out from us how many customers are there from UK how many customers are there from Germany how many customers that means each and every like country wise I want to find out total number of customers from the customer service again single table just have a few columns like customer ID customer if you want to you can just write down your people just have what's my name's other column is a customer countries countries so you can have some duplicate country also us is repeated 23 times UK is repeated to three times now from the US country how many customers are there from UK country how many customers are there that means each and every country how many customers are there in the table I need to find out how we can write the query select for all the countries each country how many customers are how many customers are there in each and every country music I'm not getting no problem no problem so here we have a different countries I said each country how many customers are there how many customers how we will find out by using counter will give you how many so each country how many customers are there each country means whenever you say each country is grew by welcome so Group by country we need to use so the final Curry will be select count star comma country from customers Group by country so countries last question so when do you use joints oven there are two different tables not only to even if you have one table we can write a selfie John right so we can create an alias of the table and we can create so joints will be used if you want to get the data from one or multiple tables if you want to join the tables we can go with the joints okay so that's all from my side so whatever you know so you answer perfectly fine and from manual testing you answered everything almost a job and just Java you need to prepare well so mostly I have not asked any practical questions from java but you need to prepare for a practical questions like program oriented questions and questions are fine so you answered well whatever you know you answered well only thing is practical questions you need to prepare from SQL or you need to prepare Curry okay so critical questions are fine but I need to prepare some more calories okay that's all from my side all right so thanks for attending the interview so prepare well and if possible again I'll take one more mock interview in future okay if you are prepared well thank you very much thank you thank you

okay so before starting the interview so let me give you a few instructions and then we will start okay so this is going to be a mock interview and it will be recorded and then later it will be posted on YouTube and the second thing is if you know the answer so I can tell answer if you don't know you can ask me to skip the question okay okay so are you with are you fine with that okay so I have two years of experience in automation as a manual and automation testing so let me ask the questions related to manual and automation testing like along with selenium so first let's start with the manual testing okay so before that so can you please introduce yourself I'm handling the manual testing at the automation for the at the moment I'm handling only the automation parts and before working here I was working as a support staff okay and that's all about okay so what is can you explain the process so you are following in your company so just tell me your testing process basically for manual interview play that once all the bugs are fixed will be doing the integration test and the regression test so I have been testing also know I'm not involved in that okay so do you know the what is the basic difference between white box and black box testing is actually we are looking into the cars so what is a static testing and dynamic testing I'm not sure okay no problem so before suppose Avenue like you have some documentation right like you have a function requirement documentation and you have a decent documentation that you will test them so like you will review those documents before actual software is ready so special in the v model right so you will do some kind of testing on the documentation level that is comes under the statistics because you are not testing actual software but you are testing the documentation part which is talking about the software like in the documentation and design part in design how the software will be like design requirements everything will be there in the documentation right so you will go through the documentation you will review the documentation whether they are correct or not completed or not that's something once the software is ready or once the building is ready then you directly test the software so that is comes under the dynamic testing okay yeah no problem so let's say I have an application and you have to test the application but I had to have any requirements so how we can test that we can do at home testing okay so what is the night of testing there is no there is no system you already have some details about what I'm saying is you don't have any details you don't have any requirement you don't have any test cases or any documentation just do you have only application so you want to do some kind of testing on application so you don't have any documentation or anything with you so in that case what kind of testing you will do I'm not sure no problem so basically exploratory so what is basic difference between the exploratory another some requirement even though you even though you have to you don't have a documentation you know some days you have some basic idea about application like you based on your previous experience or based on your previous project you have some experience based on that you will test that application but there you know the functionality list but in exploratory testing you don't have you don't know anything about application at the same time you don't have any documentation with you so in that case you will perform the exploratory testing so that's the basic difference okay okay so when do you perform smoke testing and Sanity testing a complete product okay and what about sanity sanity basically talk about the basic function like whether the software is properly installing or not okay and because if the install is gone if installation is got broken so you cannot do anything else right and all the libraries are present in the installer or not all the dependencies are there in install or not so you will basically test it that's basically comes under the smoke testing so even the developer also can do it developer before providing the bill to the testing team so they can do smoke testing right even testers they can do the smoke testing Because by the time of installation all the libraries are probably installing or not they can test it does go smoke testing and even what is testing sanity testing is done by the testers so once the building is installed whether the basic function is working or not because mean application is home page is playing or not logging is working or not because until he is working can you cannot test the other features or other functionalities right there's a basic functionality testing which comes under the sanity testing so first to smoke testing will be done and then Serenity testing will be done so smoke testing can be done by developers as well as testers for a sanity testing will be done by the testers okay that's the difference okay so do you know what is the difference between build and release building what is the release what is the release of something that we gave them yeah so basically the building play the uncompleted software which is not completed yet right is in this still in the development stage or testing stage and some piece of software which we can say is a piece of software and still it is under the development and testing but the entire software is developed and tested then we will finally released to the production right or release to the customer so that is basically called as a release right and that will be the quality product finally okay so you mentioned in your profile like you are familiar with the cross browser and transformed testing so what is the basic difference between these two crossbows and cross platform testing we are using Chrome browser Firefox platform that is cross-platform okay so can you just come again what is the basic difference between cross browser and cross platform is mainly multiple browsers multiple browsers and cross platform is the operating system will be different okay and what else only operating system and is there anything else different Hardware configurations so all these things comes under the cross platform OK Google supposed to listen you have some requirement right so you have to start writing the test cases so for writing the test cases what you will refer what is the input for that and while writing the test cases will you follow any techniques there is no problem do you know any testing techniques even though if you're not using project but generally do you know any tests I'm not talking about software development process models and talking about software testing techniques the weather in the test cases so have you followed any testing techniques while riding the test cases know okay do you know like what is the equivalence class partitioning boundary value analysis or decision table have you heard about these things so they are actually techniques party while preparing the test cases and tested okay so do you know about agile process how they will different from other places models I just know the basic functionality of another functions okay so what is an what is an additional thing you can see in agile how it is different than other places like that is it's a two-way Sprint okay two weeks pregnant so all the program programming and the testing goes side by side okay there is no complete stop to the I mean the production bill so when they there is about it's done and that is side by side tester OK Google lower the computer built right or complete software so even frequently after every Sprint we will be able to deliver the software to the customer and finally he can use the software and again you come back you come back and tell what are the latest changes are required so that we can accommodate in the software so that is the main specialty of the Hazel process right okay so in agile do you know about what is product backlog and Sprint back lock screen all the tasks to the specific number of people and there will be here so if there is something that is that has not been done in a Sprint that is called a Sprint completed no actually this is not not about any task is a difference what is the task task is something which is requirements requirements in a job we basically called as a pic and stories right so product backlog basically contains the all the stories which are collected by the product manager so whatever the customer is a toll writes all the requirement will be put inside that product backlog so those requirements are basically we can call them as a stories so they are called they're all available in the product so that's called Product backlog basically product owner or product manager will prepare the product backlog so from the product backlog we will choose some of the stories or epics and we will plan for specific painters specific printer right so they are basically Sprint background so that means whatever number of stories for that particular so which we can call the message Sprint backlog okay there's a basic difference between product backlog and spring backlog okay and what is the duration of Sprint cycle normal duration is 2 weeks or two weeks okay so 223 weeks okay depends on the project and number of stories and what is Scrum meeting and what do you do in the scrap meeting and how it is how it will happen in the Jail daily tasks up okay yeah so it is going to be 15 minutes turn on yesterday and what are the new blockers are there or what is the plan today and all these things will be discussed in the during school meeting and it will be around 15-20 minutes and daily stand we can also call it as a daily status and do you know any ceremonies in agile process what are the what are the ceremonies will be done in the agile process like a Sprint review meeting in respect to meeting have you ever actually OK Google have some basic skills and automation I can see in Java and selenium in your profile so let me ask some questions from java first and then we move on to the selenium okay all right so in Java so what is the basic difference between a Constructor and a method how do you know what is Constructor in Java or Construction in one single class yes okay so then what is the difference what is the purpose of Construction Construction plus if you want to send some data to those variables normally we can create a Constructor so whenever you create a object of that class The Constructor will automatically inbox okay the time of object creation itself will pass the data to the Constructor and Constructor will initiate the data into the variables and that will be automatically invoked by the object itself at the time of object creation and why we create a method in the class the method is normally having some logic so which may take parameters or may not take a parameters or may return value or may not return on your requirement you will Design the methods in the class so if you want to invoke the methods through the object so as soon as you created an object has through the object you can explain better so that's a basic difference between Constructor and methods all right so no problem so do you know about overloading Concept in Java what is overloading multiple arguments are passed through the same method okay okay so multiple arguments in the sense what is the basic concept of overloading can you elaborate okay no problem so basically we can create multiple methods with the same name in the class because when you create a class we can have multiple methods with the same name but when you have the same name again the message we will change the arguments or we can say parameters so we can specify the different parameters can be different as a one method is taking to parameters that will take three parameters or if it is taking to parameters again that I can be different so in that way we can create multiple methods within the same class that is the basic concept of overloading so while how we can call those overloaded methods when they call that method depends on the parameters suppose play calling the matter when you pass to parameters so whichever method is be created with the two parameters will be invoked similarly when you call a method with three parameters so the meter which we created with the three parameters in the class will be so depends on the number of parameters it will decide which method we need to call to object right so there's a basically called as a method overloading like we can create multiple methods with the same name the same time we need to follow the number of arguments should be different if the number of arguments should be same then data type of parameter should be different there is a concept of and what is overriding what is overriding no problem let me just leave that concept and okay let me move on to the automation so for example you have 100 cases and how we can choose the test cases for automation how we will know what is it to be automated how to test cases should not automobile automation systems so whenever you start automating test cases we need to give the high priority to those test cases and trusts same number of cases will execute again and again multiple times so we need to put lot of time and effort there so if you automate those test cases a lot of time will be reduced if it will be reduced so play the first part is always go to data-driven test cases like a data is required some test cases available to use data will be there and then regression test cases we will choose for automation testing okay all right so in Automation in selenium especially have you know about are you know about locators Concept in selenium you know about anything else so what are the different locations are supported by selenium so do you know what is an expertise Shimla to HTML tag okay so how how expensive will identify the element how expert is how what base is expert work actually how expert will work on work while identify the element or do you know anything about Dom document object model so basically Xbox one so normally if you just look at the page HTML page or whatever like period so whenever you Xbox Xbox on the dump structure it will navigate through each and every note to find the element again we have different type of expert but normally expert will navigate to each and every note and then find the element okay all right so what is the difference between find element and find elements so there are two methods that are available so find element will find the element that is the first one only one element of the same Xbox all the elements that is with the same expert will be returned okay okay so for example let's say I have find element method in that I provided one locator and that located is matching more than two elements play more than one element and which element will be returned by the find element the first element okay so same thing for let's say find elements in the find elements also I created one locator and that locator is matching with multiple elements then how many elements the five elements method will return all the elements right so for example yeah so in the for example in the find element the locator is not matching with any of the element there is no element with that locator for example and then what will happen in case of find elements time out of 30 seconds or something like that the code find elements in the find elements also I provided a locator and there are no elements or matching in the web page and then how the find elements method work so the locator is not matching with any of the elements so whether it will throw exception or not if there are no such elements in case of find elements are you sure okay so no problems are not available find elements with their return 0. 0 development find element method will return the web development whereas find elements method will return the collection type set collection of list collection list of element so if there are no elements or matching find elements method will not throw any exception it will just return the zero elements okay that's a difference okay so what is the difference between clothes and Bitcoins clothes and Twitter so what is the difference between clothes and twitter.com 10 browsers are open I want to close based on my choice as I want to close second browser or fifth one or eight one so how we can do that how we can close it so based on my bass on choice just I want to close specific browser instead of closing specific one so I want to close multiple browser windows but based on my choice will it take any parameters they won't take any parameters okay and I'm not okay okay no problem okay so they don't take any parameters basically so okay so do you know about like window get window handle get window handles do you know about these two method get me to handle and get me to handles yeah I just know about that okay so what is the use of handles so this is related to my previous question so if you have it and I want to close specific ones based on my choice so then we need to get the browser window ideas so first we need to capture them and remind me to write a loop statement like we can repeat each and every ID browser window ID we need to switch to each and every browser window and whichever browser window occurs based on the idea that will be closed so it depends on our choice we can close but here we need to write a logic by using get me to handle and get window handles okay yeah so what is the use of for actions class have used actions class action clubs so basically actions class provided different methods so by which we can perform the mouse operations like mouse mouse what is the what is the method we can use to perform right click action contacts to click.com okay so what is the difference between actions and action do you know about action no problems by which we can perform the most operations right so there is something called action interface so we can store the action so action interface can store the action that means suppose when you do some hours of operation let's say action class object dot so context click off some element dot Bill Dot perform you will write the statement right so when you say Builder's action will be completed but when you say only right so that will return it so that action object will be stored in the action type of variable and then we can complete the action by by using performance so that's a basic reaction is a class action is an interface which can store in action and perform is a method by which we can complete that actually so there are two things here creation of action and Performing that actually play creating the action then perform will complete the direction so that is a basic difference okay so how to handle the job dot so I want to select option or value from the drop down so how we can do it any idea so do you know anything about Alexa suppose if you don't have a select class we have other approaches to handle the Dropbox okay just go through them and which is very important also in automation okay so how do I change the parallel testing suppose I have a test case I want execute on multiple browsers at the same time so how we can do how we can do it we can use a test engine do you know about sessions in Destiny assertion what is an assertion so if you want to compare something like if you want to make text message start a session we cannot say there's a test case when you automatically there should be some validation point right in Destiny how we can apply the Variations by using assertions so very important okay you have to learn that okay or do you know about data provider interesting like suppose you want executive with the difference of data and that will be provided by another method so that method is basically we can Define that is a we are having a we can use methods and classes and there will be object repositories so there will be we can reuse the court and better understanding of the models okay so what is the use of page object model what is the benefit of you will get from the main benefit is that we can use the code in multiple places and a person can easily understand where the methods are called the names will be used to that okay okay yeah whatever you said this correctly and basically application right so you have so many test cases are there it is one page on your web page application there is one page and let us say which country is a 10 elements and you have about 10 to 20 test cases are there which are referring the same page okay the same page elements are you using in 10 different test cases so what do you need to do normally if I don't use page object class or page object model you have to identify those elements in every test case right in every test case you need to identify the elements and then you have to perform the actions from the elements so let us know if you have a 10 elements let's see how a 10 test cases in every test case you need to identify the elements I need to perform the actions in every test case and what is the problem in this the first problem is you are repeating the same and duplication is there and suppose tomorrow let's say some attributes are properties got changed for those elements you want to change the location to go to each and every test case and then you need to modify those elements attributes the locators you need to modify right because your same elements you multiple test cases so that is a problem so to overcome this particular problem we go with the page object models in the page objective please send every page we will create a separate passage object class so there we will maintain all the locators and action methods so the same page object class will refer in multiple test cases so in that way we can avoid the duplication and tomorrow if there is any update in the attributes we can directly go and modify the page object class so that will automatically invited all other test cases okay so I got it so that's the main advantage of page object class okay so this is all about selenium so I'm done my side okay you answered well so special for manual testing and but you need to prepare more on Java specialist because I have asked questions I'm not asking any practical oriented questions so I'm just asking questions very basic okay but whatever you know you answered well but you need to prepare more on Java specialist okay because you have two years of experience in automation but this time you should know more okay okay I will expect more play Ashanti's experience but you need to prepare well okay possible I'll take another walk into you if possible OK Google that's all thanks thanks for attending the interview so thank you bye-bye

okay so hi Rahul welcome to mock interview so I have a 4.045 experience or in manual testing as well as an automation testing so yes before starting so let me use some instructions okay so this video will be recorded and later it will be uploaded in YouTube are you yeah so I can see which is in front of me so you have experience period testing and then I asked some questions you have more experience on automation than manual testing I can see for 5 years almost 3 years of experience in automation okay so I can mainly more focus on automation testing so before starting so can you just tell me about yourself yes my name is Raul and my native place is chapra Bihar I am currently in Bangalore and I have a total of 4.5 years of working experience in software testing field and in my project actually I was responsible for automating detect using Java selenium and in that we are using GitHub for during the test cases and we are using May 14th and building management and we are using Jenkins execution and 0445 requirement changes happen so no managing all 1810 meeting the customer expectation is really challenging task so we we need to design our framework in such a way so that any changes coming future so that we can accept the changes and we can give the you know a quality software to the customer and also sometimes like if there's any communication gap that is a very real because we have very frequent communication in the agile model but sometimes due to like you know not the requirement that time also we get some issue all right so the food documentation process we don't have much documentation parts so we need to travel to get understand requirements so let us say you have a number of test cases on the application so how we will ensure you tested all the scenarios and all applications okay so for that we'll see what is the acceptance criteria for that particular application and going through that acceptance criteria we will see all the test cases we have automated according to the customer expectations and according to the you know acceptance criteria said by the product owner or not and end-to-end functionality are working fine or not all the basic and critical features should be working and whatever the business flow of the software is that should be working fine without any defects and they should not be any Critical Defense then we will say like we have tested sufficiently okay and do you maintain any checklist kind of thing so whether you covered all that test cases or executed all the test cases and do you make any kind of any kind of something like that so currently like oh we do have chocolate will be there like the main functionality will be there addition to be working and also like what are they expectations that you know we want at the end of the workflow of the application should be proper but more or less I will say like you know we discussed all those things in a Sprint planning meeting only and documentation will be there for the you know important and the critical features only functionality will be there in the manual test cases and are disability should be there so we'll follow that okay okay okay okay so while your testing your application a manually so what are the various types of testing you can sew in your project specifically in your project okay so in my project I have conducted functional testing and then integration testing and then system testing and also regression testing okay so what is an integration testing integration testing 150 data flow from the one model to another module like supposed to models are connected with each other so we want if one data is getting created in the first model so this should reflect in the other model so we will verify that and sometimes in you know integration testing the data that is created in the first will be required by the other model to pursue the further testing so this scenario will check in integration testing okay so have you done any performance testing kind of thing in our application status yes yes yes yes or do you follow any techniques yes sir we follow test case design technique for that test will be at 10:00 and we can cover the maximum scenario so in that we follow one even realize she sending different methods that we followed by Design the test cases okay okay okay okay okay okay okay so all right so in your career 4.5 years of experience did you or did you miss any bug or which is again in production it comes and what are the next steps have been taken yeah so it happened like one time I missed one bag actually so in the first project I was new to the organization so that time I have missed a bug and because I was doing manual testing only that time so actually somewhere I cannot recall the exact scenario but it was like something and need to be created in the other model by integration scenario and that was not present so I could not test it that in the other module and so that was you know how many days so we have you know how to fix that bug okay so what is the next reactions have taken so as soon as you found bug on the production so what is the next step you have taken on that bug so as soon as you get back in the production so we need to fix that immediately because you know it will affect the customer business flow so for that we will conduct a meeting and we'll see which one is present in the production and how it is affecting the business flow of the customer and also we will analyze will do the root cause analysis meeting why this bug has come and what is the weather it is in the United States to get together and we'll try to find out the cause of that and we will try to resolve which as soon as possible then you will do the testing of that and then you will again move to the production right so when do you perform regression testing testing we will do once after you know four five build this application main functionality the basic functionality become a stable then we will write education test cases like for automation purpose if I'm talking so I will write the automation test script once the you know application become sustainable then we will do the you know education testing because they will be less feature will be there so that can be tested manually also and button if you become it will also take more time to do the same thing again and again and by the time the software become a table so that time we will start automating the manual of scenario what are comes under the greatest so when you perform the regression testing so what are the things you will be considered so the main thing that will consider while doing the irrigation testing is like a what are the the frequently used functionality like throughout the you know application what are the things that we have frequently doing it manually and those scenario and the critical one the smoke test scenario will first you know like what are the basics scenario cuticles scenario that will first automate and for these some functionality that is newly developed so that is not acceptable some changes may happen that functionality in future so we will not automate those things indication so in the manual testing point of view so what are the things you will consider suppose you have to do something on the bill so before doing the regression testing like what are the test cases to executed during the regulations cycle and what kind of for scenarios or you will test during the testing after when the bill comes we'll do a smoke test scenario electric scenario and then after that we'll see all the critical basic functionalities are working fine then we'll go in depth in the application and then we will start regression testing and you know like the submodel functionality and what are the internal functionality implemented so that we will do first after checking whether the main functionality are working fine then we will go for the regression okay so do you ask anything about the developer is fixed or something so what are the scenarios are impacted because of those pictures or anything about that to the developer sometimes we do have communication regarding that and sometimes because if I'm responsible for a particular model so I will be having knowledge if a dog is getting 15 150 model so which model it might affect okay so best on that knowledge also will find out that so basically when you perform the regression testing first of all you need to know what are the impacted areas what are the bug fixes the developer has done and what are they acted areas so until you know that information you cannot find the relevant test cases to be executed right correct before that even yeah sanity and smoke this is also most important because we should be stable before testing the regression okay yes and do you know what is the difference between change request and feature request as a crescent and a for have you heard about this terms yeah so change the question is like you know change the questionable play relaxation India time and you know I like the other term is like a farm we will if customer is asking whatever requirement he is given so out of the box if he's asking something to do something to implement something so that is coming today for yeah so normally bugs we can call them as a customer change request so if there is any box we need to fix it normally we can call and feature request is nothing but again by the customer so let me ask some questions from java so how much rating can you give yourself on Java from 1 to 10 8:00 okay so just tell me some important features from java which you use in your own automation so that we are using in autumn what time is the first and very important one is inheritance concept we are using so because you know automation framework we are creating a base class and that we are extending in all the other test scripts so there we are you know writing the using test in the basic configuration what are the common frequently performed action on the web page so that we are writing there and also we are using abstraction because we are using you know some reusable methods we have created into the utility package so that we are calling and we are not worried about the implementation of the matter how do you implemented and we are calling that method so I have sex and is there and also in utility package only we have YouTube like for selector if there is a drop down so for like we have implemented by lifting or visible text so that we are using and one important feature of java that we are using in Palm classes in capsulation okay because you know in class we are defining all the element is private and making that class is public and setting better and set a method to use those developments inside our test strip do you use any collections what kind of connections set an alarm in that case we will return elements and if you get window handles then we will get that we are using okay so what is the difference between certain listed in Java especially so main difference between certainly that in list duplicate subjects are allowed and insert duplicates are not allowed the city main difference what is the use of final keyboard so final keyboard can be used with class can we use with variable and also can be used with method so if we are declaring class as a final then we cannot create child class for that you cannot extend that class and if we are declaring a method of final then whatever implementation we have given that is the final implementation we cannot override that and if we are declaring a very well as final then we cannot reassign its value at the time of Declaration of the variable only we have to give it a particular value so what is the difference between final and finally and finally is a block that is used in exception handling so inside finally we write the resource location code that is open at the part of the try block okay okay okay so let me just ask some coding related questions okay so I have two numbers I need to just find out the largest of two numbers and without using this condition so how can you write the code we can share a notepad and you can just write a small piece just use the largest up to numbers and without using this condition play for a long time ago eclipse and if you have Eclipse you can DirecTV okay so I need to take two number and I need to find the largest of the two number and will you give me the numbers and I should not use if it's condition yes okay so that we can do give me one minute timer now if he is not better than me just return B so that is obviously I can recall it now a long time but not you that okay so I can just play some music period and you need to find out how many characters are in uppercase and how many characters are in love with this program and just Define a string variable let's say in the spring you can just throw some welcome to automation something like this and you can just give some of them capital letters some of them are small letters okay so when you need to find out how many are lowercase characters and how many years hey Google hey Google is it done 1 minutes almost done okay so what is your expected result here is I need just find out how many uppercase characters and how many lowercase characters right so you almost have to count the account just modify this program and just check that character is getting you need to put two conditions actually so one is Asian is having all the characters are greater than a and less than Z the uppercase then increase upper upper value see if we can just say if the character is better than smaller and less a small Jet and you can use you can increase the lower price so yeah let me just ask some questions all right so how much rating can you give yourself on selenium especially on the scale of 1 to 10 yeah so I'll get myself 8:00 a.m. tomorrow yes we have viewed implicit wait and explicit weight sometimes also flew into it okay so why use waste statements we use way to statement to you know because selenium is more most of the time faster than the you know like the browser so to do this synchronization between the script so that like if we want to come pick up elements should be visible I should be loaded properly on the web page so for that purpose we use you know synchronization we are using to match the speed of selenium with the webpage so you said like you use some explicit weights in your automation right so when you specify explicit weight you need to have some conditions right so can you just tell me some expected conditions yeah so strict conditions are like the multiple conditions some of that I can and then visibility of element located by presence of element located by all right so this is so what is use of for dessert capabilities desired capabilities is used to not set the required whatever the requirement we have like we want to set the URL we want to set the you know we want to open the window in incognito mode suppose we want to maximize the window so that we can use along with that we can you know we use the respective class and we can make that capability and more mostly the desire capabilities to set the platform and set the mainly we can configure the what type of browser we want to launch and what type of version and what kind of operating system so what is a dog document object model what is a Dom any idea so you mentioned like expired so what is expert and how expensive part of any particular element so in my project we are using Comcast customer service so in the HTML code in HTML okay that is not exactly its statement it's actually a view actually so lower the code they have returned for a web page that will be reflected in HTML when you browsing the page normally what happens is for the same HTML code the Dom structure will be created by the browser itself so expert is basically work based on the notes so the HTML code is the same representation will be there in the Dom structure so document object model we can call it as a document object model so expert is basically Works based on the damn structure sometimes you may seem the kind of exception the element for element not found in the damn something like that yeah yeah because it's basically looking for the elements or looking for that structure okay yeah that's fine and what is the difference between absolute and relative experts socks directly we are going to the particular desire you know no no sorry we are finding the element by just using the double how far is it that will go to that directly you know desired element and in relative expert we are writing it from the rooftop to the desired element in which relative expert you're talking about no in absolute absolute value to directly go to that address and which one is more preferable to use DirecTV if you are using absolute expert so it will be very big so in that case and also it will be faster in execution if you are using you know if you okay so do you see any any shoes with spot any dessert but when you compare with them so in absolute expert disadvantages like I can but I can understand is like I have not encountered any research kind of thing so basically we go for real right now so in between there are so many notes are there so whenever some changes is happening in the webpage right some elements may be added to another place that will automatically impacted the Xbox so if you write an absolute Express from the root note to the current North some even some notice impacted that expert will be automatically broken so that is a problem for us right so it will not be constant and it will not be consistent most of the time so that's the reason we always go with the relative expert what's the meaning so have you used the JavaScript executor yes what is the use of JavaScript University driver dot switch to the window and then we'll keep the window ID so what is the difference between get to window handle and get to window handles get window handle will give you the noises and ID of the parent window and get window handles will give the idea of all the window which is opening so and they return type of get into handles is set of string where the return type of get window handle is string okay that's great so let's say I have a drop down so I have so many options are there so how to find how many number of options are there in the top okay so for that we can you select class method in select class get options method is there to return the list of all the options and then only we can apply size method to get the call okay so how we can do the mouse operations so what are the different methods and glasses are used to perform Mouse operations class and in excess class there are several methods like context click double click move to element and these are the methods that we use dragon season 6 so in the testing is so do you know about how to session yes what is the difference the main difference between hardest and software search if you are using hard as it then if the assassination like whatever the next line is there in the same path that will not get executed and if you are using software then even though validation is failing then the next line get executed and at the end the result will be you know attracted by the in the last will use assert all method so that will give the result of the failure okay so in the testing do you know about the prioritization on the test engine okay so we have so let's say I have a few minutes are giving the priority and some of the methods of not giving so when I execute or not supposed to execute someone else and the first method I have second method one third method again 0 okay so there are two methods which are having 0 priorities and which one will execute first so the two methods that is having 0 priority for that execution will happen but on the you know alphabetical order and for the other one according to the priority that we have defined okay okay suppose first time you have executed let's say you have 100 test cases you have executed all 100 test cases and some of them are got failed some of them are got passed in the second round you want to execute only fail to test cases so how we can execute so for that inside that we will get that we can execute only if you have involved in hybrid even framework so can you just explain about your framework what are the components you created what are the reusable components how things will happen in your framework yeah so you know which is a combination of different camera like data-driven modular driven and Method driven so that are even because we are destroying all the data in a separate folder and we are using no utility classes to read that method in utility package we are creating you know highlighted and executive so using those methods we are reading the data and modular even because we are writing the test cases for particular model and we are storing that in a separate package so that that's why it is a modular even family and Method even because we are you using several no reusable methods and also inside the Palm plus we are creating the usable methods for the common action performance that particular webpage and talking about the components in my framework we have a base class so in base class we are configuring all the you know common sense that we are coming on the browser and play using the configuration notation we are writing those and also we have utility package inside that we have Webdriver utility Java utility absolutely in Webdriver utility we are writing the common methods that that is required for automating the test cases like selector wait for way to load and except a lot of so this methods we are writing inside the driver utility we are initializing those rebellions by using you know any element dot yeah can you tell me that we are using inside the Constructor and we are initializing those web elements and we are declaring that as getting started method we are decaying in that class so that we can access those elements inside our test strip and also we have a defense that we are using as a unit framework you know testing tool and using test engineering scripts and also Tiffany basic configuration that we are using in our Base Class and also we have a resource folder there we are keeping all the driver executable files and we have a screenshot where we are storing all the screenshots of the cases and as we are using one project so there is the one that is the email file we are executing our framework in the Jenkins okay okay okay okay okay okay so and in the hybrid framework so what kind of reports you have used what kind of reported so the HTML reports vacation reports or any reports like something like that anymore so how frequently you run your automation my escapes and we are making sure that every functionality is working fine so how many bucks so far you've found through automation yeah so approximately I have like personally you are asking how many I have found out in the blue automation so while you are executed automation your automation also will find some bugs right yeah yeah yeah some cases for so like approximately 120 bucks that we have found through automation script okay so how many cases are you have automated So Far So yeah so you know in my team there are three members so you know I have automated like around 2:50 p.m. cases in this country not not like personally I have found because you asked about the whole you know personally I have found like 35 bucks around 35 through Automation and as soon as you found box for automation how you will lock those bags how do you report those bugs to the developer so for that we are using jira tool in Girard and then he will be automatically generated and then description do you have any Integrations between your Automation and jira have you skipping okay okay okay that's fine so you said like one you have used in your project so what are the benefits you will get when I use Maven project can you create a maven project so the main benefits of new project is we are using it for Bill creation and Bill testing so that like multiple Engineers are working on the same project so if any modification is done so if that modification is breaking any future then we'll come to know easily within your own project and also in May 1 we are using dependency feature so that you know all the required for that particular project it will automatically download from the Google repository to the local repository and we are using plugins like your favorite and you mentioned like Jenkins or so you have used so what what are the tasks you have done in the Jenkins so Jenkins have created like task and creating the task we have also configured like you know like configuring the Global variable that is required for that particular task and also like the plugins that is required in Jenkins to execute the tasks so that I have done and I have mainly used it for the like executing test cases for drinking to check like whether whatever is script that we have written is working fine or not okay so how Jenkins will get the code so Jenkins that and in the configuration part we will give location of the GitHub location will give there and from the GitHub it will you know constantly monitor location and whenever this is coming then when we are starting the execution for Jenkins it will download that file from the guitar and then it will do the execution okay that's fine so how frequently you check in your code in GitHub on daily basis or weekly basis and how frequently check in your court so Lake we are taking it almost on the daily basis at the end of the day whatever Court we have eaten so and yeah infinite review is need to be done like if any other details so they like we will review them then we will merge it so we are taking it on a daily basis do you know any basic commands like comments for OK Google tester automation tester so whatever you know that is fine to manage but you need to learn a few more like a logical related programs that will be okay and the largest questions but programmatically you need to improve a lot you need to adjust some logical related program so that will improve your skill set and from selenium also and whatever questions I asked most of them you have answered correctly and yeah so almost you have 4.55 thank you very much

Transcription for C:\Users\ankus\OneDrive\Desktop\AtharvAI\output_audio_files\audio_23.wav:
hi everyone welcome you all so today we have an hour to give mock interview he is almost having three plus years of experience in manual automation now let's welcome him right so high and work welcome so how are you doing I'm doing great how about your phone yeah I'm good okay so are you ready for interview yeah okay so before starting let me just give you some instructions okay so this recorded and later I will be uploaded on YouTube and if you don't know any answer for the question so I can just ask me for the sleep or else I will tell you the answer for that question so okay and shall we start yes so yeah so have gone through your resume so maybe you have experience on Java selenium skills on those Technologies so just can you just reading yourself on Java Selena and Justin on that I can have some questions and let's say 12:10 how much baby can you give a Java 777 okay and selenium 8 877 so can you just please introduce yourself or whatever experience and your projects and on what technologies you have worked on so can you just please explain 2. 5 I know what else what is your contribution towards your project are you team member or are you leaving any team I'm not leading the team so I have 4 to 5 minutes I mean they have several criteria so whatever I can do through automation I can do it if it is not possible through automation then manual test results so usually come to me to automate certain test cases okay why do they work okay so you don't like you have experience that the totally years of experience Automation and have done manual testing initials ya perfect man have sex or two point five automation okay so the complete automation testing experience is 2.55 okay so let's say I have a Constructor in Java so how we can call the Constructor from the main method from My Mother by creating an object or if it is static then no need to create an object that I can call through a classroom is construct a static or not okay so do you know about all writing concept can you just tell me the difference between you are more methods in the class with same name overloading so we can differentiate it either by giving different number of arguments okay are different data I mean different data type to the arguments so to differentiate between the methods if it has same name it is called overloading okay Constructor basically should have the same number of class and it should not have written type okay so we can see if you want to use through parameters so we can have only one Construction are you saying something okay then what is the difference between overloading and overriding in overriding suppose we have two classes Class A and Class B if you are inheriting class A to class B supplies an object in class B and call a method which has same name so if you want to use plus okay okay so I'm asking about overriding so without a Super Key Word can we already have a method if it is from same class I mean if I have extended Class A to class B then without over I mean without a Super Key Word we can use the same method in class B without support if you super key word then will be called okay okay so what is the use of a final keyboard Final we can use it in variable method and class if he initialize any variable with the word final then we can't change it if you use final keyword in method then we can't use final keyword in a class then we can't hear it in another class okay right so then what is the difference between final and finally final is a keyword in Java and finally is the block so whenever I use whatever return in Spanish weather in Texas is passed out so the whatever it is written in final block will be executed okay so do you know about like finalized method what is the finalized method and where to use it okay so that's fine so there are three key words like a keyword as I said we can use it for variables method and classes and finally is a comes under exception handling so which is an optional block which we can use along with the try and catch and there is another method called finalized so basically that matter is come from the Base Class object class and which will be used to clear the objects like a garbage collection concert so if you want any objects or like unused objects we can simply say and if you want to clear those objects we can go with the finalists so very important so finally final and finalize all right so what is a what is the use of static keyword static we can use it to I mean the static is related to class it's not related to any object so even if you don't create an object we can directly call through classroom so here no need to create an object if you start with the word okay yeah basically when you have a static methods we can directly call from the last name without creating an object okay so can we go over a static methods Suppose there is a class in which there is a matter which is static method so can we write that message into class so if there is any static method in the parent class okay so we can still we cannot over that we can which will automatically belongs to the child class okay but we cannot override that method because which is a starting Method All right so do you know about Hybrid inheritance hybrid what are the difference what is multiple inheritance how we can achieve it if you have to explain suppose I have two parents and there is one child so that's a multiple inheritance how we can achieve it can use to exchange okay so do you know what is the reason behind that it's due to mainly there are same as in class and if we extend both classes so she will get confused whether it is from ARB so it is not possible okay so then how we can achieve the multiple inheritance and those two parents only need to be classes so those two parents can be interested so interfaces we can Implement by using a single class right yeah my we can actually parents are interfaces we can easily so for example I have a 250 as a parent and one is a class then how we can exchange them into subclass I think they say yeah let's let me just give the cats they say A and B on the interfaces C is a class I want to get all three into some other subclass so how we can write the statement in Java how we can extend them into some glass so that's it sorry OK Google interfaces all right so do you know about collections in Java I know list and a little bit more Selena Gomez so do you know what is the difference between list and set can you just tell me some differences that cannot have duplicates while the list can have duplicates okay then list can handle multiple elements effectively compared to set the elements and set the list has more methods and which we can operate methods compared to list okay okay okay so for example I have a list collection which contains some items so I want to start a specific item from the list so how we can start from its index.com so how we can extract a specific item from the set directly give you the indexes is airport will you support in set index concept is supported in set no sorry I'll store it in a string so that way I know but I'm not talking about I'm not talking about just talking about something else I want to exercise specific value or specific number from the center in case of list collection having sex in case of collection so we can actually specifically from the set because we don't have a get method there yeah yeah yeah but how can retrieve the specific value from the setup without I'm having an index how do you spell possible can I get the number of index is not possible so then how can I start a specific value from the center by using index because index is not supported collection okay all right so we have used list and set collections synonym of automation so if I want to iterate through certain number of elements do I store all the elements in set playlist ok so in the welcome sting so whether the oval is present or not so far that we need to write a program so can you try this you have any notepad I'll just give the access screen sharing so I can just now share your skin and you can just share your eclipse or not but whatever I do you want so you want to use you can just say it and you can write your program now I can see yeah just take a screenshot whether this thing is contains the oval or not okay so I'm not asking to count how many vowels I'm just asking to check whether this thing contains or not at least one no I just want to print like a yes or no for the string contains Google just print yes or if it is not just say no or cancel if it is not content then just print faulty levels I guess that's not contains what is the contains method will do contains will check particular string is present in the main street or not and inside the contains again you are calling ignore case equals is that method available in Java have you ever or previously have used this matter I have used it in listing okay okay okay okay so that's fine so I can actually write a regular expression for that okay so I can simply say with single line you can find it so you can just write a statement I'll tell you strike without if condition so I don't want anything else condition so not there so whatever logic you have written logical it is correct just check whether will it work or not okay yes there are contains a e e i o u mention all the ways okay so logically it is correct but without using defense condition so if you want to check if you can use a regular expression do you know about anything about regular expression in Java okay so let's say the same string and the same thing I want to find how many total number of Wells are present in this thing so how we can find so will it work is it correct logically correct just I want to find so I want to find total number of hours so what exactly we're doing here we're just taking string contains the I owe you and immediately your accounting but I want to check each and every character so how this will work with heels condition I'm not sure if it is correct but so do you have any ideas you have to capture each and every character okay from the beginning of the end that's the first we need to start to eat and then m o c l e w like that and as soon as we started a single character from the end you need to check that character is equal to a e i o u one of them and if you freeze equal to 804 then you need to increase account so basically how to use a phone number for whatever you want okay so in that way you can count and you need to find first length of testing according to write if a condition in the looping statement every character by using carrot method to get married to find out okay okay so let me ask some questions from selenium you say like website so what is Webdriver Webdriver is an interpreter okay so what is the root interface in selenium is design actually have you heard about search contacts in Salem search contacts okay no problem from there wherever interfaces extended and whenever again implemented by using different classes okay like Chrome driver class Internet Explorer driver engine driver class okay Firefox driver class so those are the different classes are implemented web driver interface and interface is extended from the search contacts for search contacts is Route interfacing okay so for example let's say I have given you 100 S cases for automation okay then way to start actually what are the test cases so how we can arrange the order I will I can give you okay so before starting automation let's say you have 100 S cases so now you need to automate test cases how can you give the priority to them like what is cases will automate first like 1 2 3 4 like that so what are the best cases you will automate first second third like that so how we can give the priority to the test cases so first I'll run the test cases which I'm working if they have developers so fast those test cases first then the functionality of that test cases are through that if anybody have affected so I will soon so I'll check based on priority so we will give the priority so we will prioritize the test cases you are Developer volume I don't know I'm not talking about a defect or defect play here I'm talking about the test cases let's say okay we have 100 S case in your hand so you need to automate them okay so I'm on 100 so what are the test cases you will give the high priority so first priority of the test cases what test cases you will automatic fast okay first before that I'll give it to starting up an application no no I'm not asking about any annotations or data private just leave it inside I'm just talking about you have to say 100 test cases 100 test cases if I ask you what kind of cases you will automate first but I'll check the basic car critical functionality of the application basically execute smoke cases first okay okay to check the critical functionality critical functionality of an application I was working out correctly or not okay then I'll go to then if it is possible then I'll go to regression I'm not talking about execution also I'm talking about automation scripts so at the time of execution rest of the things but at the time of automated test cases if you have 100 cases what are the test cases you will choose for automation based on what is cases for automation no problem so the criteria will be especially why we need to go with automation testing because we need to reduce the repetitive tasks does the main objective of automating the test case is right so we need to avoid the application at the same time we need to reduce a lot of time and effort in multiple cycles of testing does the main objective of automating the test cases right so if you have 100 S cases first we need to give the high priority to the data driven test cases Suppose there are some test cases which needs a lot of test data so if you do them manually right it will take a lot of time and effort right so first you need to cancel those type of test cases so first you need to automate them and then the second priority will go to the regulation test cases like Suppose there are tests we need to execute on every cycle of testing right whenever the baby is released from the devil so those test cases you need to find out those type of cases and you need to automate them that's the second priority and tired party is whatever other test cases you have so which were able to automate and you will automatically so this is actually need to follow will automating the test cases and I'm not talking about execution part of execution again happens it depends on the situation but here I am talking about the selection of test cases for automation okay okay okay yeah okay so next let me ask one more question I say suppose they say in your application there is a drop down you don't have a selected for that okay so what are you doing so whenever I enter three directions what is the element through far Loop so so if I'm looking for a particular element so I'll match it in its condition if I get the text from the element if the text message the element which I'm looking for then I'll click on that okay that's good okay so let's say suppose I want to take up to the screenshot of their application Suppose there is a failure so I want to capture the screenshot so how we can write the code for writing the capturing the screenshot there is a big screenshot okay I'll give you a screenshot of force through five 448 can I share your skin once again okay so that I have a filed okay so we will Define the file source and they will copy The Source into Target file right so let me ask one question here so here you said like take a screenshot is equal to take screenshot of driver you mention right why what is the test screenshot of driver what exactly are you doing there and type testing so why we need to do types here again because the driver doesn't have the knowledge OK Google don't know what happened to us like that okay okay so let me just clear this so the basically when you create a driver's license and you have to do type casting because take screenshot is an interface and Webdriver is some other interface so both are no no way related okay so where driver and a screenshot these two are the two different interfaces which are implemented by Chrome driver class okay so which are implemented by Chrome driver class so when you create a driver for instance before starting this you will write a web driver driver equal to Chrome driver like that right so if you create that way with the web driver and interface here you need to do that casting okay because why we need to do this because driver is an instance of interface so take screenshot is nowhere related to wherever so we need to type casting yeah suppose when you get the driver's license can you just make a statement I'll tell you okay sir no not here just before writing the method just write a simple statement I'll tell you okay so just write whatever equal to new Chrome driver so if you define the driver instance like this using Webdriver interface right so then you have to do that casting like this as I said we need to type casting because screenshot interface is different and both of us if you are created the drivers license like this you have to type casting OK Google so in that case you don't need to type cash because don't have class is already implemented screenshot interface not my point so if you define the driver instance like this you no need to type that you can directly send the driver into TS now we can just remove the time casting not required okay so that's fine so can you just explain about do you know about actions classified send text to perform okay so for example let me say OK Google okay just can you write a statement like this let's say actions actions act equal to new actions and actions will take a driver's license will take driver instant so we need to pass the time now right next to statement is the actor Dot so for example if I don't specify the perform okay so I haven't used for method just remove the performance and what will happen if not I mean it's not good till that the elements are Motel Sault why it is not completed so we have not so is it mandatory to use performance company so suppose let me say I have a requirement like this suppose I want to Define some action okay but I don't want to complete that action immediately I want to perform that action after sometime okay after doing some more steps I will perform the end of the script I will perform the action so how we can get the statement let us say mouse over action I want to perform at initially I have created that action but I don't want to complete the reaction so after some statements after a few tests then I can I want to do the most or action okay that means I want to complete that action after sometime or after completion of few statements so then how we can achieve it okay so how to write a statement when you will write the performance so then what next reaction will be popped up only when I write dot Professor so it will be complete okay so let's say after this statement I have written some more statements for three minutes and after that I want to perform the action so in that case will you write the internet will not perform will you write the entire statement again so then how we can do it so I can store it in one element this entire thing okay okay okay so how we can just tell me I'll give it to ask something so I can OK Google what is the type of the variable what is the time is it okay so let me just like this very important the building is nothing but which will build that action which will not complete an action there are two things actually creating an action performing the action okay so the bill method will just create an action which will not complete or which will not perform so once it is created which will return the action type beat so have you heard about action interface actions is a class action is an interface right so this will be actionable oh okay yeah can you define that way because action the Beloved Country is a performance yeah now you have just created an action and store that action in a way so later if you want the company that action you can just simply say ask for phone have you understood now okay so creating an action and Performing action we can do those two times in separately or if you want to do at a time you can simply say I have to move to element you can call or if you want to just create an action later you want to perform the action simply you can store that an action variable and then you can perform later okay all right so can you just tell me the difference between find element and find elements find element will return here ok Google is not available in the webpage okay so what is the return type what it will return I'll get an exception for No Such elements okay so in case of find elements same again locator I have written which will matching with multiple web development but currently that that locator is also not matching with multiple web elements so in that case what find elements will return element intercept so if it is finding multiple elements at a time okay so but located is not matching with any locators any elements on the web page so then what what find elements will return so it doesn't match rights okay have you understood so do you know some of the expert assess what are the experts are available and have used those access methods your automation so I can if I need to index under a square braces okay that is one thing okay so in selenium like how to handle the broken legs I say in your life there are some web links they are broken legs like how to handle them so every link is associated with the name okay so what I'll do is to find elements and store all the elements in one list okay so I'll write to 0. 5 7 if the responses beyond the 400 then I'll mark it as a link is broken or I'll give it as link is working so whatever the response you get response code is greater than or equal to 400 so they're all comes under broken legs okay yeah so you know automation so in the framework especially have you seen have you written something like reading data from properties file have you mentioned any properties files in our automation about properties.com username and password so all this data is available on my property is fine so I want to write a simple code and through which we should be able to load the data from the properties file and use it for your testing so how we can read the data from the properties 5 I'll send the property under the property I'll give you the part of the properties file okay then I'll load the data through okay then there is the get get get get get method I'll get the element which I want to get through okay that's good yeah okay so like you mentioned you haven't said you have used in your project we are using our own company name mention something called craft framework okay and can you just explain what exactly it is and how things will happen in this framework a crap refers to Cognizant reusable framework for automation testing center okay okay okay okay okay okay okay so there is a dedicated thing for this framework so what do this okay everything the specialty of this case it is more interesting we have to work with the keyboard driven testing okay okay no problem so let's say Get it can you just tell me what are the some reusable components you have created on your framework so it is common rights almost in every framework there will be some reusable components so just can you tell me some of the reusable components which you have created in your framework for logging but giving getting URL giving password and then username this is a common thing which will do so I have returned so that I can use to our application we have several things so that I am looking for insurance policies so under the policies there are a lot of types that I can create policy for five years and years 15 years so at 2:30 from logging to selecting and products are so in between there are several things which are common so I have stored at several I mean work clothes in a method so whenever there is a different I mean if I want to select a different product for 10 years at 5 years only at that time I'll get the test case apart from this if there is any common thing then I'll write it in a message as I told you are okay okay okay all right so how we will maintain the page elements application simultaneously page so we have started by element method so we have stored each element in a variable so we are calling that variable into a text message okay so that's good so have you seen any advantage when using page object model approach yes sir the main advantages that usability so if I want to use one particular Webb Elementary School schedule so just I think you have some knowledge and test changes so let me ask you questions so just what are the can you just tell me what are some main features from text Angie like what are the main advantages of benefits from test engine you will get we can produce results in HTML format okay we can give priority we can run test paralleling then we can provide data through data provider annotation then we can select a text message to run I can sell it to 40% and I can group the best places to write an annotation depends on so if it is any method is dependent on another minute so I can use a different song okay that's fine so do you know anything about exchange is not what is testing is not what is a use there are will be executed okay yeah that's great okay so in selenium we have something called desert capabilities just can you tell me what is the use of dessert capabilities we can give you the version of the browser if I want to run it in a particular version so I can give you environment in which environment I can run are I can give you the browser in which one to run or if there are any certain configuration that I have to follow before running and test case I can do this configuration in this capabilities okay so I have no let's say so do you know anything about headless mode of testing I've heard sir but I haven't used it I had listened to be initiated everything will happen if you just know what are the challenges you face in your automation testing so I automatically insurance data has to mimic the real user data okay so if I run several times a particular test case with several data so each time I have to give accurate data so it's difficult to decide the data every time and second thing is I have a lot of problem with the stadium have tried a different methods to handle an element exception till now I haven't found an exact like Universal solution that I can apply to eat still in elementary exception and there is one more thing whenever I start and application I'll get them up so it's like I'll get that pop up at random times it's not like picture so to handle that I have to use Auto 80 still haven't applied that I'm learning activity so these are the few difficulties challenges okay okay and how frequently will not automation cases I ran for small cases everyday and then depending on the requirement and how many manual cases we have executed so we will execute 7280 and what about reporting so how you will get the results and what kind of reports have used in your favorite report but only a popular test cases will take the photo of every floor basically every page will take screenshot so we will have really depend on screenshot and we have a backtracker okay so Under Pressure will upload all the results and the small description of automatically will be created under book tracker for each defect so will you will give you the details of who is the tester whom I want to assign will be our from Master Underwood description like very quickly so right everything about okay okay so I'm done my side so let's come to the feedback for 2.5 hours of automation experience so you answered well so I just need to improve some kind of programming logical skills okay because many people have seen many people so many people are able to answer the question from selenium testing and automation framework all these things specially for Java programming when I ask some questions from Java programming even though they are able to answer properly but when you write even ask you write a program so people are not able to write the program properly okay not able to build the logic on the spot okay so you need to improve on that particular area and apart from that in automation testing point of view okay you answered almost all questions and whatever I have asked for 2.5 years experience that is fine okay you answered and only thing is you need to just improve the programming skills all right so that's all so best of luck and are you currently working okay okay great thanks thank you have a nice day thank you thank you bye

Transcription for C:\Users\ankus\OneDrive\Desktop\AtharvAI\output_audio_files\audio_24.wav:
how are you doing today hi Matt I'm good thanks for thanks for your time I'm glad to be here cool well I think we can just jump right in we have a really juicy algorithm problem that I've asked at least 50 times so I've got some pretty calibrated expectations for it and it's there's a lot of interesting talking points on it but enough about that tell me a little bit about yourself what's your favorite project that you work that you've worked on my biggest problem is a YouTube video player I designed it to change the comment system it's rather than like comments or a live chat I got to combine it to you online can you tell me about any interesting challenge you faced while working on that feature the biggest challenge was just getting the timestamp out of the video player cuz it's kind of like a vanilla domination problem but then you have to pass it in two different reactions I had to like look at lots of different stuff okay so that the back end was pretty easy you know the API figuring out the how to how to send the relationship between all the messages to the front and that was pretty straightforward for you yeah I was just added the timestamp as well characteristic on the comments and that I handle the the morning and the display of the comments on the front end and so how was what did you use for your front end like UI aircraft products cool all right well thanks for the context and I think we can just we can jump into the the code so if you if you don't mind sharing yeah you're on top of it also you can share your shoulder pad session so I'm going to give you the prompt and I'm going to let you figure out any other information you need to get started on this I'll give you I'll give you one example too so you know about do you know about Aquarius drinks if you search on Google and your little question mark Q equals and then what do you search for you so it's any anywhere else that is a question mark is everything after that but today play we're just going to include the question mark in the Aquarius ring so given this as an input we want to make this a multi-line comment given this is an input we want to turn that into an object that looks like this question mark and then for each pair we could just do not split on the equal sign in order to get the key in the value can I assume that there won't be any amber Sands or equal signs in the actual keys and values yes yes the keys and values will be encoded and right so there's a question mark in the beginning and then as you were saying each hand yes all right so I would call this song called Clarity string still taking a string python so I'm sure there's a nicer way but I would just strip off the question mark then I would just split 8% well I can just use this input if you don't mind I'm just going to get rid of the actual clear Okay cool so that works for this case do you see maybe Any Corner cases where this might fail or are you happy now is there were no input time so I don't think there's any edge cases as long as there's but it's perfectly valid for the query to be empty so that would mean yeah there are no key value pairs the input would just be a question I don't know and therefore you can try that out and make sure yeah yes have a key that does not have a corresponding value so let's say bass in that case we want the value to default to the string true all right now period stop call the pair after I call that split the split pair and then it's like one length is not to it's probably one I didn't check that just for like a little bit of Education and then I'll put the same statement to check if it's a empty string lights off before we move on to the next part of this question cuz that's a little tricky I want to push you to simplify the logic that he have in here I see some question mark sorry then that'll be okay yeah I don't see it immediately could the value be at the string or the volume louder appears multiple times we want the corresponding value in the resulting object to be an array of all of the values associated with that key in the order that they appeared yes yes it's a little awkward I was just saying call you wanted to do it up here too right yes thank you so sorry I got distracted anyway I'll check if the output es is a string already if it's a string then I'm going to do something that's right oh no no no I think it's undefined first cuz I don't think you can do well I guess type of undefined undefined right you can also you can also just check if it's strictly equals undefined yeah okay there's some some boring historical reasons as to why the type of check is a little bit better but checking with strict equality is totally fine turn off so if it is a string that's between the right so I'll let you down be an array holding the original string and then that all makes sense do you want to test this out a little bit example and all the cases or is there some Corner case where we lost support for one of our features I don't think so I think it's okay if you have a double key and an empty string Bell I still think you don't want any empty string Keys even doubles still I don't think you want that right now equals hello and full we expect to get true and hello but I don't believe we do specified twice but in that case we're losing the first Associated volume OK Google do you have true for every pair with every key without a pair value cool so that looks good we have a little bit of time left for this problem so I think we can go to the final stage of the final level all right so remembering all the features that we have for for this training in the shape of an object as you saw before let's create the original query string and it'll take an object which I will call first maybe not the most clear but I like it first okay so for this we have to go through every key value pair and just add it on to the end of a string informant equals value the order we really only care about Preserve in the order in the case that a key has multiple values so we want to preserve that order but in terms of the order of different key value pairs we don't we don't care so you want the the keys with one value to be together they don't have they don't necessarily have to be together but the values for repeated Keys have to be in the same order that they were in the the past object that doesn't seem too hard to me so strange then for now in Valerie stop key plus equals 9 + 1 and then again I'll just returned question mark well we need to pass on an object to this yeah sorry I passed in the past string passed by my previous function sure okay cool Apple and I can also happen to hear ya can you do this without without duplicating the code because I trust you to get a working by putting the clothes a little bit and have that feature the code for that feature in one place and not two places so this function is going to put key value pairs into queries I don't know if this is like a practice but I wanted to clear it inside the main function tonight I will and we have all of that in there and we have great yeah just order Okay so we've got the corner cases pretty thoroughly mapped out we did touch on one more thing that would be an obstacle for you to ship this into production or release this is release this is some some package that other people would use yes so there's there's something still quite limiting about this this approach it's not performing using this in the in the real world and wanting to encode really arbitrary keys and values and Aquarius string can you think of anything else that we might want to add to this specifically for the second function well both of them really and this isn't a new feature this is this is this is a if they're still there still a bug with some inputs so what if I can you can search for you question mark is not going to have any question mark in any or any value right so how is that possible question mark so I'm down online 115 there is the encode Yuri component and there is decode Yuri component so it's your you know in code and decode respectively for the code for the project here I will scroll up to our first algorithm and we don't need to add this to both of these because I don't think that's what we can skip the actual encoding for that is Let me refresh myself so that's that's the final the final feature got it 3% 3 J or something like that right right so I told you the functions that we can use for this so you'll want to use I'll just show you for it so this is actually and I believe that would do the trick yeah and then without that you would of course get the ugly 8% 3F Buckles in yeah yeah that's a function your anytime you want your you have an Impulse to build some kind of write something to like Escape HTML or Escape things like that on your own like that's really hard problem I would strongly advise that works for both so we would do this the way the way that I did this so I did call the function on the key and the value all right cool so that's the question thank you for that those those those great lots of interesting points and you're in a good place to for this what I wanted to do first this talk about the tell me about yourself question and then then we can get back to the algo here yes please okay yeah how do you fill the tell me about yourself that also requires the the other person to ask questions and that little back and forth I really that's a great Point talking to fast yeah you were almost slurring your words a little bit and I could understand what you're saying and you were still communicating pretty accurately but I think if you were to slow down a little bit I don't know take a deep breath or were you were you nervous or just high energy how are you feeling I think a little nervous okay yeah that's that's totally fine that the only happens I think like just physiologically one of the things that I do that really helps me prepare for big calls interviews things like that is to just really give my neurons a break so that can be like go for a walk outside for five minutes or stare at a wall definitely don't be on your phone don't be on Twitter Instagram whatever oh my God yeah just you know find some way to wind down before the the interview another really big Point too about like the back so your YouTube clone project right that's like a massive scope and really interesting and we I wanted to dig into your your threading the the the the the the comment thread feature having like replies and things like that in time stamps wait did you have threads where like one person could reply to another and then one to another and so on and so forth yeah but not if the comments are made at the same time is it was loaded before the new person starts before the new person reply Okay cool so that's a really juicy problem and I I got the impression that you as an interviewer in that exchange I would have I would have assumed that there were you know pretty significant technical aspects that were overlooked right so you know YouTube scan like of course 100 comments one of the features you're going to need for comments is like pagination and then when you introduce another feature as we are noticing today with this query string problem right you have these these two different features like this defaulting to true and then the supporting multiple values right like those features like when you implement one you could break the other so like supporting threads and then supporting pagination and supporting timestamps like that sounds really complicated and I was hoping to hear a little bit of you know interesting technical challenges that you faced with either the API layer or you know a statement on the front end or you know the database layer right on any any challenges pick up recursive function to display all the replies to a comment it was a little bit tricky yeah okay so there was no pagination right you just loaded everything okay but does it load does it attempt to load all the comments on its own or will it improve will it only do that if the user like clicks you know expand or Scrolls down or something you can there's like a tad you can click on it so obviously like that wouldn't work like I do YouTube scale and that's okay for a project like this but I think it's also really really important so you don't have to build something that's going to handle all those cases like especially the this massive scale of comments but to really to get like half of the value is to acknowledge that like okay I build this it handles these once you get past say like 2000 comments for this technical reason and you know you could explain like oh I didn't get to that because you know it was a it was a pet project or I decided not to write like I felt like you were just glossing over those those technical challenges and I don't know if that's because you weren't aware of them or you want to solve them or what right that to me felt like a blind spot in in the tell me about yourself also another I think untappd opportunity right so you mentioned teaching say you taught physics right yes cool have you taught any of your peers in at Academy or any project that you've worked on right like interesting point to dive deeper on to dive deeper into and and interviews right so you have this teaching background a good engine interview a good engineer is going to of course another stuff but they're all going to be teachable and to be teachable like being able to teach others really helps and then of course once you you know get past the you know entry level junior level Alright you're going to be leveling up your team as you yourself level up and that ability to to teach to you know convey complex Concepts right it is really important and to have that that other that to have that that expertise and teaching teaching physics is transferable here so I think I think any kind of case study that you can imagine any kind of examples little stories that you can tell what would be super interesting in in in an interview like this so you know it's really interesting projects I think I think you can just really enjoy the Point Drive the point home for it by telling some interesting stories about how you've taught your peers and then all so getting into the Weeds about some of the technical challenges because like building YouTube clone of course like depending on the level of complexity you commit to is incredibly Rich it's a very rich technical problem cool do you have any questions on that feedback so that's a really good advice about yourself like that that's a great problem so I I am not sure that I would ask them directly but right like it's it's it's it's a conversation so you can there's there's some signal to you of what is interesting to them in either their you know their their face looks or questions that ask you as you as you're talking so I think that pretty much any interviewer would find both of those subjects pretty interesting it's just that maybe if you get really into the Weeds on some technical aspects say like the YouTube YouTube comment section if you were I don't know interviewing and like mongodb right that's a database company they would probably be really interested in how you orchestrated that on the database side if you were doing this for Facebook they might be really interested in the interactions between the front and the back end right like it's there's like a there's a contacts that's a little bit more relevant based on the company that you're talking to yeah that makes sense yeah and yeah it's a conversation it's a negotiation now cool so great questions Mia and back back to the algo what did you well I want to ask you I'm going to ask you two questions so how do you feel it went like you know strong strong fail fail pass strong pass what do you what do you think you can you can keep it up because I'm going to be making some code changes in the feedback so actually yeah let's let's keep a big picture and then when we get back into it I'll have you share again and I'll show you some code changes so we still have good time for that you can see it right I think was a good job of passing the specs I think test cases yeah but how do you feel like objectively how how did you feel the interview went pretty well so in terms of this question do you have any feedback on the problem before I give it before I get into specifics google.com you did with the format query string and the the other the other problem yes so this one I think is a little bit between like a theoretical like algo late code style problem and slightly in the direction of like practical coding because I was saying I don't think there's really anything conceptually in terms of like advanced advanced concepts that's too crazy here it's really the challenge is really riding elegant code and having in not introducing regressions with each additional phase for the the problem and then visiting those Corner cases along the way so so this one this is actually quite representative of a question that you could see in an interview and then the focus as I was saying would be on envisioning those Corner cases as well as not introducing any questions you know clean clean clean code this could be a pass not a strong pass and to get to a strong pass what I would have wanted to see was the proactivity around envisioning those Corner cases which you would never would you eventually did you came up with the the good Corner cases you're really good about that you're a really good about variable naming but I am still staring at 9:13 this without Ampersand this is actually without question mark but that's that's pretty minor thing that doesn't that's not a big deal yeah so your code was was really easy to follow but I once again I did have to push you to like consolidate your code to simplify it and that's something that I think like proactivity around that would be good too so like once you get to a working solution then you can like start thinking about like does this does this work other opportunities to clean this up right there was like the also it's pretty easy to follow along and that that actually you stuck with the code I think really just the two main things if you're struggling in your interviews is to be proactive about those Corner cases and then also if you're if you get to a working solution and then look for ways you can tidy it Tidy Up Your solution too do you have you have any questions about that yeah do you want me to show you a few opportunities to simplify code here further Okay cool so let's just look at the format query string so up here this this is this is all great slicing splitting and then you're doing this here I'll just get rid of the commented code for a moment so this one this format query string is pretty tidy there's really just one thing that I think could simplify it a little bit further and this is this is just syntax this is pretty minor so okay so valleyside you want it to default to the string true so that can actually be done by destructuring so you have this this thing here and that is let me let me put this up here so you have this let's comment this out for now what you can actually do instead of these two lines of code is you can just do constant key valve equal split pair and yeah if you want to get this this defaulting to true then you can just do it here so that is there's no value in the original array if this array is lovely you get you get all that functionality there and then if you want you can even here so this is kind of like Advanced it's not a huge deal if you don't get that that tide is that a little bit going down to your make Quarry string I'll get rid of some of the code here I'll push you a little bit to come up with the the idea behind this simplification okay so I do like the helper function I think that's that's quite helpful but we still have this like if it's a string do this if it's if it's not a string if it's an array then do the other thing do you think it would be easier if we just could assume that it was an array like if it was just always an array yeah definitely can you make that happen type of Valley Stream vowel equals spell yeah that's cool and then if you want you could even inline this logic period and maybe the only 15 or 20% get all the way to this like final stage of doing the inverse function and I've only had one other person come up with this in code Yuri decode Yuri component right so like this is this is like the final the final boss right knowing that so like this certainly wouldn't fail anyone but like with problems like this they're like there is there is like a certain amount of domain knowledge that can be useful right so this is curious drinking and code Yuri component decoy component that's crazy stuff and then like when your when you're like a senior level especially with front and experience I guess back into you're going to be this encoding and decoding he's going to be like very top of mind so this is something that I can see that I think can like separate June it's a signal of you know like Junior versus Senior level kind of thing so problems can seem easy on the surface but it's the execution that can really reveal the strength of a candidate and you did well but of course for there's there's pretty much always room for improvement do you have any questions so two different questions those feel like very different questions to me about like helper functions and then all address helper functions so helper functions is one of the great ways to separate concerns so on one of the questions that I really like to ask is counting the number of islands counting the number of square Islands in a matrix so there's this really popular leaked problem counting the number of islands in a matrix if you add an additional constraint that is counting the number of square Islands in a matrix then all of a sudden people get really overwhelmed with all the corner cases right so like you want to make sure that the entire square is filled you want to make sure that outside of that square it's always water or out of bounds and then you want to make sure that nothing is touching on the corner there's like a lot of corner cases and with a problem like that if you're considering all of those Corner cases for each line of code that you write I've seen candidates where they spend the entire hour talking about the problem and writing comments and they don't write a single line of code that's pretty rare but like that's the kind of problem that can do that and that's where the separation of concerns really helps creating different helper functions that elegantly break down the problem where you have this little helper function and you only need to think about what's the input what's the output what does it do what's the contract so however functions I my strong opinion is that if there's a helper function that you have thought of and that's useful use it like I haven't seen anyone write too many helper functions ever in an interview so if you can if you can imagine one then then do it in terms of like pseudocode is let me let me get a little bit more General so do you ever feel this impulse more like talk and code at the same time in an interview or not yeah okay so let me replace the word talk with like communicate so the okay I don't need to do that so the priorities that I see is Priority One is code project you can communicate with the code that you're writing or comments that you're writing and if you're following best practices you're not going to be riding a ton of code and not talking at all even if it's a problem that you've seen before right if it's a problem you've seen before you still probably aren't going to bang out a solution without any bugs when you get to when you the times were actually think about like pseudo code is when I don't know what code to write so if I don't know what code to write then perhaps I'll write some pseudocode to help break the problem down or write a helper function and think of the if you don't know what code to write then write pseudocode or talk through it but don't try to talk and write code at the same time that can be that can be like counterproductive yeah so pseudocode on demand talk if you don't know what to write any other questions awesome well Brian thank you for doing this question Justice you did a great job and I think with with a little bit more targeted preparation for the tell me about yourself question and you know any other other just soft skill questions you're going to be able to extract a lot of value from your background and I'm seeing a good level of Baseline fluency I'm seeing a very clear thought process you're writing pseudocode and you're sticking to that you're not diverging and writing some other approach I'm seeing like very good mechanics here and yeah just to get from someone that can like pass in an interview to someone where the interviewer is going to be is going to like fight for you as a candidate the next the next level is to in proactively Envision those Corner cases and tidy up your code given the opportunity good stuff man all right thank you very much for your time and your feedback thank you yeah hey I hope you enjoyed this month interview that was actually in my interview between Brian who's a brand new developer he's trying to land his first position and Matt who has extensive experience in the software engineering industry and he actually helps a lot of Junior developers prep for interviews just like this but he actually created his own platform at coach Matt Ayo and you just practice algorithms and it has a little bit of a Twist it's not so focused on memorizing the algorithms but more focused on learning Concepts so if you want to check that out definitely do so and also let me know what you thought of the interview in the comments I definitely want to hear about it did you love it did you hate it I actually read every single comments so I do appreciate people that take the time to do that and if you want to find a community you're looking for a Discord Community I actually own one I'm going to leave the link in the description but it's a junior friendly Discord Community we have about 2000 members there and we'd love to have you thank you so much for watching us

welcome back to another podcast episode where we help aspiring developers get jobs and Junior developers grow this episode is going to be a little bit different we did a front-end mock interview in fact I invited a good friend of mine Dan who actually interviewed me for my second developer position he volunteered his time to a brave soul in our community his name is Noah he's aiming for developer position right now and he volunteered to be on camera do a front end interview on camera I hope you like it I think this turned out really great now this is going to be released on video and audio I'm just gonna be honest if you're on audio it's not going to be as good of an experience but you are welcome to listen in I will actually include a link to the video in the description for the audio so you're welcome to listen in just want to give you a heads up but let me know what you think about this new type of interview and if you want to see more interviews like this I'm happy to do more enjoy cool awesome thanks so much for doing this my interview with us I'm Dan I'm a front end developer currently working at coinbase prior to that I was working at Albert where I worked for over 5 years I was the front and leave there and I'm kind of treating this as a friend and interview for a more let's say level position front end specifically using react and yeah thanks again for doing this so just to give you a bit of background on how this is going to go first we're going to have a few conversational questions just so I get a little bit about your background we're going to go into some more conversational questions about HTML and CSS and then we're going to start putting some of your skills to the test with some first we're going to be writing some more just straight JavaScript in a shared text editor and then after that we're going to be putting together a little project and react so for for the coding portion and really for for this entire experience it's definitely not intended that you get everything right it's not something that you finish everything it's really just to get a sense of just how you approach problems problem solving you know so I encourage you to talk out loud as you're coming up with Solutions and yeah super excited to be doing this with you introduce yourself and just tell us a little bit about yourself and your background sure my name is Noah I have been coding for the last two years teaching myself to code on the side and I'd say about 8 months ago I graduated from General assembly's full-time software engineering and yeah pretty much since graduation I've been working on multiple projects hackathons done Sprint work with with the team and I have a buddy of mine that I work with every day coding going through prep work for interviews I have done some interviews in the past I'm currently doing some interviews thank you for doing this so yeah I'm curious what what kind of got you into programming well it was during the time I was working with my previous employer I was working as a Salesman for his women's clothing company call now that's awesome and yeah I feel like a lot of folks like myself included learn because the job that you're doing isn't necessarily development but it's like you know sideways it's like kind of adjacent to it and then you slowly start picking it up so I can definitely relate to that that's awesome and have you have you kind of gone like have you decided what you want to take like front and back in Native yeah like what I started out with that and I didn't hear that and the possibilities was just at that point and after going through the boot camp I realized there's a whole package you know I'm very interested so yeah like a lot of these a lot of the things that you traditionally just do on the back end or now moving to the front end and yeah totally agree that it definitely translates yeah just out of curiosity so you know you're on a learning track what's something that you've learned recently that that you think is really cool that you wouldn't mind sharing I'll say integrating but you just learned so much at a court system are you going it is the current or the recent stuff that you've done more how can I put this are you building out like Reston points are you going like refuel is there like one technology that you're you're kind of following yes I am doing a restful routing and you know and points for for basically getting the information I want to do what I wanted to do logically so recently I you know I created an app that would go through actors database of films that they have made mashed up with another actors and get all the collaborations did so being able to you know go into the API digging for those it just gives you a bunch of tools and you can kind of do anything however you want so yeah it's pretty massive but don't do something so yeah so next up I'm going to go to some just more basic HTML CSS questions a little bit more technical if there's anything that you don't know that's totally fine and yeah definitely just treat this like you know it's a really a conversation so first question that I've got for you is so like say that you're putting together a very basic super basic web page literally just like serving static HTML what would be some things that you think to do like in the very beginning I mean the contacts as far as the content on the page go like we can say that it's just like a simple like about me page but like what are some some tags or some things that you definitely want to put on that page in order to to make it work well you know and I will just start thinking about the things that I need you I would actually wire frame and see what kind of is there any content that you know what would be going into that template so that you're not like you know repeating all the tedious stuff that goes into every webpage right so like things like you know like hero you know hero image you might have a good answer for but could you explain to me what comes to mind when you think of semantic HTML semantic HTML to me for descriptive tags tags that will you know at first glance kind of tell me what it's trying to do accessibility is another one of those things that has such a there's so much to learn like one can really like become an expert in accessibility alone and in fact a lot of folks do but yeah could you kind of explain like let's say that I don't know what accessibility is could you kind of like explain to me like what it is and why it matters right so so for example when it comes HTTP request methods are and could you give me like an example of of the difference between a couple of them sure absolutely information I'm just curious what are your thoughts on mobile first design and development when I think about when I first learned about HTML and what it is and all that stuff and then I feel like nowadays at least in my experience that's like that more like old school way of doing mobile friendly but yeah if you actually just mobile first and then you know as the screen is modified to like fit the extra viewport with available designs I will say that when you are thinking about mobile first though and you know responsive design and potentially like media queries we're going to wrap up this section with a couple of questions about CSS I'm curious can you explain to me what specificity is in CSS specificity would be do you mean like selecting you know I'm not sure I'm not sure what I understand what's the difference between a ID selector and a class selector and how might like what might I need to take into account when using them so for just you know HTML tags you can do like body parts for sure say that I have an element on the page that has a class and an ID and let's say that the class is Dan and the idea is Noah and somebody gave it the ID selector of Noah and said like color red but I actually want to make that blue how could I how can I write a selector that has a higher specificity than that that I think you can do it in a multiple ways I think the one I'm not sure if you're looking for this specific one but there's like an important but you know whatever color you want it you can put it out adding an important will definitely override the the current color that's that well yeah last question about you do you know what the Box model is and could you explain that to me a little bit I think the Box model is that every element yeah I'm not 100% sure that you can work off of and if you know that you can rearrange them to look exactly the way that we wanted to you can also align them to each side or talk a lot of different things great job so far that that wraps up the first portion of the interview next up we're going to go into the vanilla JS part of the interview we're just going to write some functions we're not even going to run these functions so it's not about you know making sure that they work 100 it's really just about taking some problems that we have and seeing if we can't solve them so you've got a link that I sent over if you could just share your screen real quick we can go in there but yeah so here's some of the bunch of prompts and empty functions the ideas that you're going to fill out the the body of the empty function and then underneath every function there's a little example of like how we might use it and there's a little common saying what we would expect so if you have any questions about any of the prompts or really anything at all I'm definitely here to help you out but yeah why don't we get started with the first one and let's write a function that takes two numbers and returns to some of those numbers so we have a function here and I guess I'll use this function down here you got it ok Google all of them so for instance here 2 plus 3 plus 4 plus 5 should return 14 so would this be like any any amount of numbers yeah so if you can implement it with any amount of arguments that's great if if we want to convert it to an array that's totally fine as well well I'm just I'm just wondering like how I would make it so that the parameter knows how many to expect is there a way that we we know how many to expect so there are actually a couple of ways and I'm just going to dive in here real quick so there's there's the old school way and then there's the new way and the old school way I'm just going to open the arguments keyword in a function is actually like an array of the arguments I think a keyboard in JavaScript function that is is an array representation these days you can say in the function argument dot dot dot or whatever you want to call this is the name is an important into an array so cool I'll just I'll delete that and so now ours is an array of the numbers that were passed in right so here I would then you know it over the array of the elements of the numbers and so you don't need the leading dot dot you can just say oh okay cool thank you if you scroll up just a little bit and then what this would actually do with the arguments below is a would be too because that's the first argument you would be three because that's the second argument and then ours would be an array of four and five because those are like the rest of the arguments but yeah that lets you do some pretty interesting things yeah interesting cool let's yeah let's see if we can do this next one so this one we want a function that takes two strings and it returns true if the second string is in the first string in a case and sensitive way and I would say if we want to see if we if we don't want to solve for the kids and sensitive way we can just solve for like the case sensitive in which case string includes and the in the example would return false but yeah if you can think of a way to do this in in a case insensitive way that would be great right so then we have two parameters yeah all right so here I would I guess taken to take me in two strings so stream one and string two and I want to check if the second string is in the first is that correct yep and then there's a there's a message and make everything that's inside there yes so okay so I guess my question is what what calling string string one two lowercase modified modify the the first string or no I'm not sure about that I would have to just check the end I'm not sure yeah I'm not sure I guess I can just tell you let's do one more but I'm curious what is the next three songs I feel like let's see here so you got get names which the intention is to return an array of the value of the objects that have that name in them we've got get largest number index which the idea is to return the index of the largest value in the array and then we have this this last one is the heart of all of them which is to return a function that lets us call if you can see the example here we want to be able to say like a weight delay and then a number of milliseconds and then Implement that in some way shape or form so out of those three do you have a preference for one that you'd want to tackle manipulation and more array manipulations I think with the async function I understand what it's doing there it's basically setting a timer and then after we want to do something a little more than the last song again names here is if we look at line 49 start being called the ideas I get names takes an array of objects and it returns an array of the values for the name property of those objects if they have one so as you can see here the objects being passed have a equals 1 so in the in the return we don't expect anything we really expect you know the strings Jane Mark and Sophia so yeah the idea is given an array of objects returning an array of the names of any objects that have that name property does that make sense of objects and that's what we're looking for is within the array of objects we want to see if the if the if the key that equals to name and if so then we return the value of whatever that is right so we're going to need to look over the array and check inside that move if the object contains a property management and prototype chain so it's just a little bit safer and in my opinion but awesome this has been honestly great so far and yeah so why don't we yeah if you just want to give this a save and then jump into Source / app and then now we can start talking about the next portion of the interview which is going to be building out a bit of a that's going to be a react project the idea is that we're going to be played next like thing and I'm just going to go over the the requirements there on the right so we're going to be implementing a polka dots and I think at least I Look to play some visual idea of what I'm going to be working on so why don't we click the designs and design specs on the right hand side so it's in the sorry it's the link in the yep so can't stress this enough it's not about making it look perfect this is literally just an idea for like how to or like how it will end up looking if we get to the if we get through the styling portion that said definitely more interested in building out the functionality so the general idea here is that we're going to have some sort of Select at the top that lets you pick a Pokemon and then based on the value that is selected we're going to be loading a Sprite of the Pokemon its name and the little description and then at the bottom we're going to have some we're going to have a couple buttons next in previous where if you click you know so if you're on Bulbasaur which is Pokemon number 1 I believe going to next would just load up the second Pokemon the idea is that you know previous would take you back here's the general styling that we want for this but like I said definitely prefer to focus on functionality so if we go back to the code sandbox yeah so that's generally what we're going to be building and then yeah so here's the the requirements is one having a drop down that has a list of the OG 150 Pokemon by the way I've already written down some helper API methods so a lot of that's taken care of for us but we can still dive in there and look at you know what those methods are and how they work but yes we want to drop down of the original 150 we're going to display a card that displays an image the name and a brief description of the currently active Pokemon and then we want previous to next buttons that when you click them it'll you know go to the next Pokemon or the previous Pokemon depending on what button you picked the featureless is flexible if you have an idea for something you'd like to add feel free to suggest it is like I don't actually care that you know how to implement a Pokemon or a pokedex it's really just about seeing how you approach problem-solving and react so yeah if you have an idea for anything let me know and this says you know the Design Center have to be exact but there they are and we actually already did the select because styling those can be kind of a pain so that's in components / select yeah there it is this would be too much to like expect somebody and like why yeah right but yeah so why don't we first let's go into the API and kind of just walk through those things together and by the way in terms of actually implementing this you can just you know remove the prompt from the return and then just replace it with whatever so online 16 words you can just return whatever it is that you want to you know call the thing that you're ultimately building so if you do like return no or whatever it'll just start from scratch but actually so on this page you can see that online one we have import get Pokemon list and get Pokemon description and online 5 and 13 we have this function that's kind of showing you what the return value is from both of those things so get Pokemon list returns a list of the original 150 Pokemon and then get Pokemon description for a given Pokemon should return in the description so there is a console in the prompt and you should be able to open that console and see what those yeah there you go so the first one is get Pokemon list so that returns a list of yep so it's it's name and that URL I guess and that's what that looks like and then get Pokemon description for Bulbasaur right now but if you want to scroll down and take a look at what that response looks like it's it's that and then if we want to go into the actual AP hi folder we can see those functions nice so yep that's that one's pretty straightforward and I don't think that really anything has to be done there I'll get Pokemon description right now it's saying Pokemon species / 1.2 get the current number somehow don't worry about the regular that's just normalizing some wonky formatting that's coming back from the API and then finally get Pokemon spray URL again is returning Bulbasaur but that just Returns the URL that points to the image of the Pokemon so I guess can I ask you a question about this like this is the Bulbasaur one and I guess that's you know going to be the first entry of that array that we're getting from the API the list so if this is like 149 they will get you know me too or whatever the last one is so that is actually so online 22 if you see the URL is pokey pokey API at the end of Pokemon is actually what selecting Bulbasaur it's not okay for instance flash one but if you change that to I think the next one is Ivysaur we would actually want to get slash Pokemon species / 2 and I do want to say that the get Pokemon list does return them in order so if you select the Pokemon using if we look at good Pokemon list for instance and so you've got Ivysaur open right that is the that's the second item in the array that is actually the Pokemon with the number to so online 22 here if we were to change the one to a two we would actually get the description for Ivysaur instead of nothing else the number of changes yep exactly so like if you need any help with anything at all like where to start or really any clarification around anything just let me know so I guess this is an image so there is one more utility function that would also need to be updated to be able to take any any number select Google so technically we have and if I guess the better question is do you have maybe like 20 to 25 minutes to to tackle this I don't know that I can finish this intentionally made it so that this will take longer than the time we have if you were to finish it I know there's a mock interview but we just give you the job immediately we have like more more than enough for you can I put 25 minutes on them and we'll just work on this for the next 25 minutes see how far we get sure perfect styled version of the regular HTML select so it has the same API so basically what you have to do in order to render the inside of it is give it options yeah so this this is not doing play anything other than styling the native browsers collect so I mean if you go to mdn if you if you search like mdn select you can see what the API looks like perfect perfect so yes so there is a specific way to do this in one second in which is so you're kind of music you can't just wait in a regular you know in a regular component so yeah we're going to need to as you said like you use affect and probably some states then we can use you stay probably to update the value and we want to await the Pokemon list and the way that you would do this is so which takes a function and you only want exactly so you only want us to happen once so you can pass that empty dependency array and you can kind of yeah you could do this a couple different ways if you need help thinking about which way to go like I said something like that because I want I want I guess a variable to hold it and then set up set an alarm for 9:00 p.m. and this is kind of if you don't mind I can totally help you out with this thing cuz this one's kind of more specific but you can't you have to use a weight in an asylum actually want you to make this like the outer functioning function because then it'll really so what you can actually do is just write a little function that wraps exactly what you've got inside that you can call it like like function like get data or something and then so for Matt yeah map will actually be yes and I know map will take the key and the key in the actual elements so one thing that I would do here is wrap wrap the entire JavaScript would it be okay to also like it down here yeah absolutely great and now we have a list of all the Pokemons yeah awesome and then I guess I don't know if that means it's enough time to kind of take this further but I know you have the design here so we would want this card here so yeah this one you know you're kind of on your own to implemented however you think is awesome if you want to drop it directly in the app.js by all means if you want to make it a custom component it works as well cool so I'm pretty sure we put Pokemon names and then the card here or no not outside the select card from I think it's called if I think about the API utilities they all kind of expect a number which is like the currently selected Pokemon number to store the currently active Pokemon so that we can then so we can see what we're working with you know so okay so we do get that and now if if you wouldn't mind on 9:30 if you could just cancel and then if we change the select it will I assume give us the the value of the so now we have the name the value of the name right yeah one thing though is that these are going next and since Google utility API calls to to get this data right right now so we can go back to work it would be a string so that should actually be fine because all of the API calls don't actually yeah they don't care if it's a string or a number right right so now we can say sets to be that value an API utilities and if you just wrap up get Pokemon Sprite URL in curly braces because it's aimed export OK Google that's totally fine no that's on me I probably just wrote the wrong URL but love it it's great work so I think our Pokemons and rendering it obviously like well I mean first of all obviously we're in a time crunch and like I said I can't stress enough how this is like I intentionally put together a bigger project than the time allows we've got State Management we've got looping through an API response to like build this thing out we're rendering an image that's changing dynamically based on on the current Pokemon I'm super happy with how everything went so yeah why don't we call it bring Don back in here and have like a grease hello how's it going I think it's going pretty well I think so too that was awesome I like kind of just watching from behind the scenes looks like your camera is a little Frozen down really I'm going to turn it off and turn it back on okay see if that solves it now you're still frozen with this but no how does that feel interview yeah I know I mean honestly that was that was pretty clear and I think honestly you bring up a really good point around using just tooling that that you're not used to I feel like that's something that is super common especially now that interviews are happening more remotely there's I mean even code sandbox specifically so I've actually done interviews in code sandbox before and one of the things that trips me up is that prettier is always like enabled by default so like anytime you save it like formats your code which is great I love prettier to death but even stuff like that can just kind of like trip you up a little bit so I think part of yeah part of the interview practice even is like getting used to working with like tooling that isn't necessarily your own in the past I've even had to code in like Google Docs which is like absolutely bonkers couldn't even tell that you were like having some problems with the idea that seemed pretty smooth well any final feedback from yeah for sure so okay so I think the first the first two parts of the interview absolutely crushed I was really position which you know I'm really looking at this from a friend in position like you know your answer is were like very knowledgeable in some cases to the point where I like almost wasn't expecting it like giving like detailed responses for like how they did what they are in and what they do like that was absolutely awesome I feel like just in general you were so easy to talk to and like you know you kind of like glad the conversation in ways where you would like answer a question but also give some like additional feedback or additional context which was I always think that that's just great something that I personally like to do in interviews as well because like it's not really about the question it's just about like the conversation and like the things that interest you and that sort of thing so I took some notes down yeah like your answers for like what semantic HTML is for what accessibility are like they were very like in depth and mostly like understandable so I almost feel like if I was like thinking of myself as like a Layman or like maybe like somebody who's less technical like you'd be a great person have on the team to be able to explain Concepts to folks that that really need to understand them at a more like base level which that's a skill that I personally think it's super invaluable because a lot of times developers can kind of explain sometimes it seems like you were unsure about something and then you have to be crushed the answer such as CSS specificity like what you're like I don't know but then give like explained it exactly exactly how it is I think in the JavaScript portion so you pretty much nailed like all the problems one of the things I noticed just in general which this is super teachable but you you tend to lean on like for Loops which one of these days I was kind of just expecting like a high order functions like filtering in mapping and stuff but eventually that kind of came through in the react portion so that was cool you know just like the minor I feel like lack of knowledge when it comes to async functions which again like super like learnable like that's definitely like on the more like Advanced side of JS but I did I did notice that you know there were maybe some some holes there that we would have to like if we were to bring you on board we'd have to like you know help you understand how those things work in a more deeper level but then yeah I project I feel like I got a good sense that you know react at Lakeview working level and again there's things that we would probably want to you know it would probably have you like pair with more like senior developer so you can come to some of those Solutions maybe a bit more quickly or in a bit more I guess what I'm trying to fetch data from an API I'll wait the response and then update some state in order to be able to use it cuz like react isn't going to let you write a async use affect function directly you can't use a weight in a component so they have to know how to react like jewels that sort of thing also like not knowing select is like truly whatever because like I feel like these those are the sorts of things that you just kind of like do maybe like three or four times and then it's but yeah it was it was interesting seeing your process got going from the data fetching to a input and having to like update some State based on to be totally honest I wish you would have gotten to the solution a little bit more on your own but at the same time given how the rest of the interview went if this if you know if I had XYZ company and we were hiring for a like Junior to mid-level developer I would say I would kind of put you like in the middle like definitely more than Junior probably a little bit under mid would definitely want somebody like you to be to work with a more senior developer on your first like few features for sure just like you know drive home some of the things some of the areas that I kind of found that were a little bit more lacking but that's said I would yeah if this is a real interview at say like let's move on to the next level for sure I wasn't expecting to hear that actually so I'm surprised too soon yeah no 100% so the general sense that I got is that you know the Core Concepts which is ultimately me much more important than like the finer implementation details so I think you have like a really solid foundation for getting paired up with somebody more senior and after like you know after a few months of like caring features together you being able to like go off on your own which is really like that's that's what I expect from a minute I think you yeah you totally killed it normally like yeah thinking back to when I was hiring back in the day for somebody in this position I wish we would have been talking about and that's a rat I hope you enjoyed this I'm actually going to leave Dan Noah's links their LinkedIn links in the description feel free to reach out to them and thank them for doing this if you like this video be sure to like it share it with at least one more person in fact if we get 250 likes I'm going to ask Dan if he'll do more of these I'll see you in the next podcast episode happy coding everyone

Transcription for C:\Users\ankus\OneDrive\Desktop\AtharvAI\output_audio_files\audio_26.wav:
welcome to my web development podcast where I help aspiring developers get jobs and Junior developers grow in this podcast episode I hosted a mock interview where it's more like senior level for software Engineers that are going into like a algo coding heavy technical interview and for the interviewer I invited Sophie who's the CEO of formation who has created a company does this for a living and she helps a lot of engineers get into more senior roles at larger companies like Google lived kind of just like the harder technical interviews and for the applicant if you guys watch my previous mock interview which is more for entry level I brought Dan my friend done who did the last one to actually be interviewing this time so Dan is a senior level engineer and we're giving him a sin level technical interview so let me know what you think let's jump into it hey Dan hey Sophie good to meet you super excited to be chatting so I see that you're currently an engineer at coinbase right so I'm going to coinbase as a friend and developer for about 8 months prior to that I worked at an education startup in Chicago for over five years right kind of saw that project go from like zero customers to this like actually like legit platform that's that's used by high schools in the US very cool okay well very excited to learn more about that just to give you an overview of your career history and along with some of the stuff that you're doing currently at coinbase and and most of this time on can you briefly describe kind of the team that you're on at coinbase and and the work that you're doing their yeah for sure So currently on the growth team so that really it involves like making sure that people that sign up for the platform start interacting with the platform so for instance like you know making sure that people make an account by crypto set up recurring buys really just engage with the platform and I primarily work on the react native app but as well to have fun fact I actually had not used react native before Queen's had to like learn it all on the job and it's been it's been super fun I've just been having a ton of fun like learning a new technology cool can you tell me a little bit more about kind of what your process was getting ramped up on you yeah for sure so thankfully the promise of reacts like learn once and write anywhere is actually true so like it does feel very comfortable going from read web to react native cuz like you're still just writing react also we have like a super robust design system at coinbase so a lot of the you know it's like with react native you don't have access to like all the HTML elements but like it doesn't matter because we have like just component design system components that we use for most things and yeah I mean aside from that there's there's a lot of like really awesome react native developers that are there to help people out we have like mentors who essentially just are there to onboard people with react native because yeah like react why there's like so many reactive developers I feel like react native is like definitely less you know there's like native modules and you have to like go debug I haven't had actually had to like write native code but I've had to like debug it just to like make sure that you know I mean it's been more like understanding what was causing like my build to not not build correctly and yeah usually it's just like okay like maybe it's like some dependency that I'm missing or something like that CSS and all the things that you can do react native CSS is extremely limited so it can be much more difficult to like precisely like style things but again thankfully you know we have a really robust component design system so there's not a whole lot of stuff going on yeah I think a lot more flexible because you know with mobile I feel like all platforms have more like established patterns for each platform so that makes sense I guess going back to so you are at Albert for a bit before looks like you were at glass door for some time at glass door between base and what motivated you to want to make a recent change the recent change between glass door and and coinbase I mean so yeah if I'm being honest like it was a great like love the people at Glassdoor but I guess it's just the code base wasn't what I wanted to work within I found it like with the text back or no I mean it was like a react text back but the like the client server and like a lot of the foundational Pieces Just were not very like you know like in house built and I personally just didn't feel very productive so I was like you know I kind of made this decision of like I haven't been here for that long and I feel like if I stay any longer I'm going to be here for like you know two plus years because I have like a track record for actually staying in places for a while so I was like yeah like I don't know I feel like I could go I could look for something where I find myself being more productive and thankfully I had a friend at coinbase I was like yeah like it's super chill here and like yeah like the code base is great you know like I mentioned there's a lot of like awesome like developer productivity things that just make it easier for me as a you know individual contributor to actually contribute those those features that we're trying to build well let's maybe transition over into another coding portion of this call so I think maybe you could go ahead and share screen cool I believe that should be up on the screen awesome so the problem that we're going to work on today involves strings so dictionary of words but it really just as an array of words I guess and what we want to do is fill in two functions so one function is going to be called set up and it will take this input dictionary of words and a second functionally in the input dictionary and it will return false otherwise and the goal is to do as much work as possible to function okay so I think I understand is indict because essentially that's you know given a word it's going to return true or false whether or not that's going to be in one of the original input words so could you explain set up a little more like what like why do I need to set up so it's going to give you the list of words if we did so you can either stop you cool I I mean I want to I feel like I want to set this up as a class because it feels better to like encapsulate like a dictionary in a thing rather than have like this Global variable so let's do this and I guess what it makes sense to like what I should I be able to call set up later and like reinitialize the the dictionary or something like that like not necessary and the reason I ask is because if we set it up as a class then you know we can just pass and set up having a setup we could just pass the input to the class constrictor and initialize the dictionary that way daylight test is on your dictionary with the words and it's going to be an array right so cats are and bar and then we want to test well why don't we like console logic I mean I just want to reach for a set I guess here so that's not the right way that's a word array I guess and I want to say that with spread it not totally sure about that but I think that is how we do it and then we can say return this dick dudes word right now there's like maybe like three things that I would want to look look up on mdn but let's run it and see what happens includes is it so it doesn't have done so let's oh my God cool so we can remove the console log and then that's a cat is in the dictionary Don is not I will say that I do feel like using a set is kind of like cheating since it includes like is indicted essentially has and the dictionary is essentially a set of the problem a little bit so now let's say that word original dictionary period maps to one of an existing character so this would return true and I guess one character at that place in the string right now so my first some being like arrays because I don't know what methods think we could say so honest template equals word we're going to replace that star with dots template how that works all this work so cat should still be true period false wow that was I wasn't confident not going to lie so let's say r a t so it should be amazing true true true true that one should have oh because it needs to be Global so we're going to do well can we use play all I didn't know that was a thing oh my gosh that works okay cool but kind of like kind of like this said it's like oh you know like the question is clearly asking if we can do this without a regular so yeah I mean do you want to try to do this without using like a dynamic I think you're muted yeah so let's try something else going to be I mean the Constructor just you know sets it to be an array that would be a one but then some would be oh and since we have to iterate through every word in the words of Ray and then where I kind of like where I guess just the answers I don't know is actually have no idea what the time complexity for regular Expressions is so I know that the sum is on but then the fact that we're doing a regex inside I'm sure like tweets that a little bit but yeah I've actually yeah I've never looked into actually still want to kind of try to do as much work as possible and see accumulator and the word then we can say accumulator word equals word return accumulator now instead of a word array we have we essentially turn this like cat Car Bar array into an object of key is cat values cat he is car values are or car and then he is Barbies and we do have to iterate through the array once but essentially we are only now iterating in the Constructor rather than iterating in isn't it which we would potentially be calling multiple times so the value of that is that now if the word does not have wild cards we can look and then it is in the dictionary we can automatically yeah and we could even go of a Step Beyond that and say like if like word if the word does not include a wild card and then we would only have to like do the more like the heavier operation if we are if we do have to match on wild cards so it is function at this point so like it kind of depends it's like the complexity kind of depends on the argument where ya like best case it's so one and then to check if it you know if it has a wild card that would be o n and then if it does have a wild card then it would be whatever the 01 Plus or times the Red X solution like equals so I guess is there any way that we can optimize this even for the case of a word that contains a wild card let me think my I guess the first thing that comes to mind is to like I don't know why I like just came to mind if we if we represented the words as trees could we do this in oh and time can you describe what you mean by tree can we I know that we can get this to on but I'm not sure if we can like is is Owen the best case scenario here is when you say end do you mean as in the number of words in the array no sorry the number of letters in the word okay so how do we cuz right now what is the number of words in the dictionary reducing from and to K is a significant reduction gotcha say like how can we represent the setup words so that we can then actually only iterate through the individual letters in the incoming word may not need to iterate period if you like so I guess thinking about so let's imagine that the word only has like the the single star character right now we have a pretty pretty complex character what are all the possible possible how many possible like words are there in the dictionary in the original dictionary match for sorry can you repeat the question how many possible I guess yeah so I guess what would be if you if you manually checked all 26 of those of those letters yeah what would be would be the run time involved I mean I feel like this is a trick question but I mean it would be like oh 26 which we is there a way that we can actually further optimize as such that we don't even need to Loop through that like is there a way that we can get something stored in our dictionary such that we all we have to do is a very simple lookup something stored in our dictionary and thinking about like cat for example for the word cat like sorry can you use that use that in some way to try to shift as much work as possible yes yeah I mean it feels I could be wrong because like again this is not a solution that I never really thought about before but like it feels like a lot of work in the Constructor cuz we're essentially creating like a dictionary of every possible permutation for the wild cards but let's do it whatever OK Google now so it would be the length of the words array and the ya like now it almost depends on the words right and the individual but it does give us then 01 for isn't it so cool I mean I'm down let's do it so sweet so now we have our word map is going to not only store the word but then also let's say word Blitz or each letter and I so let's think I guess we don't need a partial word it's word martial word at I is space do not assigned to read only property 0 of string lights is there like a replace character at can we slice cool so we want I'm actually going to do this in console here so we're going to save our word equals hello 5 + 1 can you still see my screen Logistics we actually want this to be four hey sweet sweet how might you adapt this algorithm to work if there were any number of wild cards that could come up in the is indict function yes so I think that you know like building every permutation and storing that in our dictionary just might be like it might be a lot so if there were if we had to support multiple wild cards I'd probably go back not to like a regular necessarily but just something that like iterates through the letters in the word and I guess the idea that I was playing around before was like could we make like some sort of object like this and like honestly like I don't know if this would work or how I would go about actually implementing it but it's actually building like a character map of like the words and lake so I think that the example like explains it better but the for instance is the third then you would have to just like I guess skip it and potentially look up the next character find the ones that have the next character in there I feel like that might be I don't know if I would give us like an actual advantage in terms of time complexity if there's a lot of wild cards is there eventually like a set of requirements were just like iterating through you know the words in the dictionary like character by character like eventually becomes more beneficial yeah so the one thing that you can build on top of what you were building with the object you could actually have an explicit star character which essentially is like very similar to what we did here in a dictionary or a set but instead of having just like you could also build up all the like versions where each each letter also has a star so that you can actually just step through yeah that's like one thing that you can do but then also like building up the the the the dictionary of all possibilities is obviously not probably something we would do in practice but for the purposes of this exercise could also work cuz it's still owe one look up right yeah well cool yeah I guess that was the that was the problem I don't know if I would have come to the conclusion of initializing the dictionary with the wild card on my own I feel like yeah like the the trade-off there of building this potentially like very large object up front versus and getting that 01 look up time in the isn't dick function and you know just why isn't it function have to do a little bit more iteration yeah for me it's like I don't actually know you're trying to optimize both the the solution that you were proposing yeah of course we could do that so that's yeah I'll definitely keep that in mind whenever I'm doing like stream manipulation stuff in the future I worked on a text editor like quite a lot so and that was very like space so I always asking people don't try to do that because they assumed worked on a text editor for a very long time but I mean so that's solution does any word have you know like does it start with a c at the sendex or but like the time complexity that would be like absolutely garbage yeah we just like iterating through every word in the in the setup array how did it go I think it went pretty well I have lots of Commons probably the thing that would make me lean towards yes because I clearly this person knows how to write code in production so I think a few kind of comments and you want me to do this here and not likely I'll show them the comment and you guys can talk afterwards so I think to start from the very beginning I think I actually probably would have gone typically pushed more in a real interview but I did want to focus as much as possible on the coding portion I think that I think one of the points I wanted to make is anytime like there's like really short cancel my appointment like you're always going to be asked about it it's not a problem but you're going to need to explain and I felt like the explanation was slightly negative and I always think that you should try to frame kind of what you wanted out of the next position rather than what you didn't want from the current position like you can always make the exact same statement more in the positive sense but I don't know about glass store saying like I was looking for a code instead of like I wanted to get away from code base that did why so that's like I think just a very easy shift to you can always restate anything that's negative to the positive by doing that but I don't think it was extreme so totally fine just a little note I think during the coding portion I felt like overall one of the weaker points of the interview was actually just collaboration and in questions ahead of like each segment where we code it I feel like every time I presented something it went to code pretty quickly which meant that I didn't have I wasn't able to kind of guide directionally liked it because he just started coding right away so a couple of examples are there's like some things where like education for example like with string questions like asking about case sensitivities like one that's that's the same word I think like that and kind of aligning on approach before going to code for example with the regular thing it's like you know it might take a few minutes the good thing is he did really really fast so I actually don't think it hurt him at all and in fact it was one of the reasons I like it is actually there's just like a lot of different optimizations that you can make and there's a lot of analysis that we can have in conversation that's outside of code so and then I wanted to point out one particular kind of segments of the interview which was the I think in inevitable trough that every good interview I think has which is when you're totally lost and how you handle that I think is one of the most important like behavioral like pieces of performance wise that you can have and I think Dan did pretty well there but I think I think it was kind of like neutral maybe well like I think there was and yeah I think that I think just going into every interview kind of like with the expectation like I'm going to be in a moment where I have no idea what to do and just be ready to like kind of like have a positive attitude working through it rather than like I don't know but again I actually don't think it was extreme overall I would have gone yes in this interview these are just some minor flags and then the impressiveness of just an execution speed and and and and the code generally kind of clearly okay that was a lot of really good feedback I know damn person is going to really appreciate that is awesome what kind of and what level of positions do you feel like he would be qualified for in this company so I would say that Cody buckets based on the coding interview if I was doing that all right if I wanted to do that I would definitely have to push a lot more on the behavioral portion of the interview so there's certain types of interviews where like the expectation is like maybe 80 to 90% like just coding very light a particular project so and I think more senior people that like will face that more on the other thing is systems design interviews are better at judging seniority I think than just the coding but I would say that based on like the resume alone but then also kind of like the fluency of the code and how like clean the code was like tell me indications that this person seems to have worked in like a high-quality code basis before and it is really like solid so yeah I would I would say there's not a lot of signal on lights in you already but you know I would say that this this passes the bar for like a senior-level coding only interview and I wouldn't rely on other interviews in the loop for other skills important to senior Engineers okay all right well thanks so much play Sophie I'm going to toss you out and bring him in stick around for a little bit if you can and will bring you back in all right how's it going today help but like the fact that like we were able to proceed through the interview and kind of like knock out some of those initial requirements yeah give me like a pretty good yeah I feel I feel good I think it's funny cuz like once you know like there was that moment where Sophie was kind of explaining or like almost like leading me to that most optimal solution and it was like hard to like she clearly what she was talking about him she you know like she had this idea in mind for like a way to do this and like what ultimately ends up being like Oh one which is awesome but for me it was like oh man like what's she trying to say like you know it took me a second to get there but yeah like once once we got there then I was like oh cool I understand what you're saying and that's what's really funny about stuff like this because like it's like the concept is the hard part like the code is I mean yeah at this point it's been yeah I've been doing this for I've been writing JavaScript for long enough for it's like I can translate the concept into code but if I don't know the concept well I'm going to struggle but yeah I know I feel really good about it yeah and I was just actually thinking of just like oh what other ways can we do this and yeah I feel like I thought of an interesting one I might ask Sophie what she thinks later okay that sounds good and yeah I'm glad you did struggle a little bit I know she would be the person to challenge you I knew she'd be perfect for it and you know a lot comes out and in an interview and just even like how you handle the situation even just you know working with her to be able to figure out the optimal solution that she's aiming for and how you go about it it's really interesting to see that because a lot of people struggle with that concept I think a lot of people are gonna love to you know what she worked through that but what are like what's one main thing that you can improve looking back at your interview so let me think I mean I think I kind of hinted at this towards the very end when Sophie asked how it went but I have like you know you tend to fall back to the tools that you're familiar with so to be honest I don't know if I would have come to the you know dynamically building a dictionary with wild cards included because like that's just a concept that I haven't like thought of so I think just like trying to broaden the scope of potential solutions for stuff like this would be helpful for me because it's you know it's one of those things where like you don't know what you don't know and now I'm like oh cool yeah like you know this solution makes sense I can probably like you know I'm likely we're going to have to solve this exact problem in the future but one similar to it might come up and you know if performance is you know Super Paramount then yeah maybe like doing a lot of upfront work so that you can get those that improved performance on the line might be like a good way to think about things and I feel like this definitely taught me that cuz like even with the original question you know like my mind was immediately like why do I need to set up function like we can we can we can literally just take the array do a do an includes or whatever but like yeah like maybe oh and isn't the best solution like maybe there's an actual like benefit in having this be like oh one you know but I think that was like probably my biggest takeaway okay all right and I'm going to share the feedback that she shared as well like it was fun to watch so I guess one more question for you going to this interview what impression do you feel like this interviewer gave about the company that she's recruiting for so I mean if I was interviewing for a like front end position I think that this might be like you know not the most ideal just because like this is not very like fun and related and it's very like it's superhero have that said I think that this kind of question to me like suggests that they're looking for people who have like a very strong understanding of like fundamentals and it's definitely not going to lie I was just a super interesting problem so like I had fun with it also the general I guess the general format I enjoyed it was very like you know collaborative which you know made me think that like the person that's actually interviewing me is also like you know highly technical which is always appreciated yeah I think yeah if I had any feedback it did seem like we were I guess like driving towards a specific solution and it was maybe like more difficult to like I didn't I didn't know that up front and maybe would have rather like you know been told that a little bit more explicitly but I mean overall I think I had a really positive experience that's the end of the interview if he liked it please consider liking the video it really helps boost the video in the algorithm and I really appreciate Sophie and Dan for doing this it's really hard to do something like this on camera in front of thousands of people so you know props to both of them but you know Sophie is the CEO of formation and you know what they focus on is helping early software Engineers prepare for kind of like mid to senior level roles and Technical interviews especially harder to get into companies like Google Lyft etcetera so you know if you feel like you need that extra feel free to check out for me it's for you maybe it isn't but check them out but either way I'm going to go ahead and Link their socials end the description below the very least I'm probably going to link their LinkedIn so you can connect to them there let them know what you think but more importantly we're probably all going to be checking out the comments so please leave a comment let us know what you think of it and if you want to see more mock interviews like this let me know as well thanks for watching everyone and I will see you in the next podcast episode

all right welcome back to another thing level mock interview for this one we brought on someone that wanted to come on he's a current coding bootcamp student so he's still pretty early on in his process but he's been a part of our community for a while and I just want to give him the opportunity to you know try this type of interview out see what it's like see what he still has to learn just a heads up just turned into more of a coaching session but I feel like a lot of the advice and the way that Daniel guide him through is pretty solid and I think it's going to be helpful for a lot of people out there but Daniel is going to be the interviewer he's been a software engineer at Microsoft for 10 years he's been a software engineer at Facebook for seven years and then he's currently at formation just helping people accelerate their careers so hope you like it and enjoy all right well hello Friday afternoon maybe where you are it's Friday afternoon here so happy Friday happy Friday around 4:00 in California again thanks for taking the time to spend with us and work through a problem I hope this is a lot of fun just a little bit about me so you kind of know who you're talking to and in case you have any questions I was a software engineer for about 20 years I mostly worked at Microsoft and then Facebook for much of that time and then a couple of small companies since right now I'm actually at formation which is a career accelerator and I'm working on instruction not engineering so we have an engineering team but I actually work on teaching and building content and helping Engineers so that's kind of my story this is going to be a a pretty much straight up coding interview I have a question for you all ready to go in the coderpad so unless there's any questions that you have you can get the problem a read and then hopefully you'll have questions at that point oh yeah let's go and get to the problem then yeah sure so have the quarterback lowercase letters only letters plus underscore determine the point value possible for the word Jenna score represents a blank tile that can stand in for any letter but has a 0.54 and I guess the example the tiles are t m o c a and the result is 53 + 1 + 1 equals 5 awesome a little confused that's ok Google so it's possible for us to make the word and the total score we will achieve making that word is is 5:00 so now let's look at the second example we do have an underscore so now this time we can still make the word but we don't score that three points for the see the underscore as kind of a wild card so it's kind of like a Scrabble game I was a little confused about the second example with you okay thank you completely and like I said on line two the word will be lowercase letters only and the tiles will be lowercase letters only Plus on their score about you know throwing in white space or capital letters that doesn't make the problem interesting it only makes the problem annoying right okay so yeah the first option that I see the solving this is just taking the the word that were given and just entering over each letter and that's on each letter a value to to give the results in some other options I think it's kind of like an object where you put in with you so we can do something like that in this case to solve the problem like what are the what are what are going to be the keys and what are going to be the values and how is that potentially going to help map return one but I don't know if that's too too much I mean there's pros and cons to everything right that's why this is engineering okay so let's go with that one will be a function OK Google oh like are you asking if if it might not be possible to make the word yes yeah it is definitely not always possible to make the word okay so I guess if word does notes of examples of interesting cases so you just correctly identified one of the other cases which is hey wait a minute we might not be able to make the word cases set another alarm for our understanding of the problem in this but we should be at this point it's really exploring the bounds of the problem in our understanding of the problem right okay some Chinese so what do you thinking about just nothing nothing nothing crazy examples comma the only one that was like if you had all mild tiles how many 12345 at what point do you know if you're not going to be able to make the word at the beginning when we receive our parameters how do you know right at the beginning or how how will the computer know right at the beginning if the word has the the tiles in the word okay can you express by the way that's not a challenge to see if the letters in the word are and if it is possible it needs to total up the number of points available right okay right we could potentially do that as two different steps like hey is this possible check it out right and then as a second step hey if we know it's possible let's find the score or we could actually do these in one in one pass in one step but both of these both of these operations are going to take more than one line of code so yeah I think separating it would be better for me now I'm not too sure how to do this and actually I might even recommend at this point that we don't write code that we actually write comments and we actually experienced the ideas we want to express and we can iteratively break those down to a level where they can look more and more like code what do you think the steps are going to be to accomplish initially I was thinking of going through the word possible and then we got to figure out if that letter is in our tile set okay yeah so like I think line through the comment on Line 39 we're actually going to do something similar right right check to see what the values are this time but like hey do we have that letter okay yeah so if I do here one question what's the see ya would that works mostly works so if it's a Boolean function there's one return statement and that particular return statement always returns true we probably want to return false at some point OK Google now let's jump back down and and start thinking about using that okay puts words so if you call the kids let me see how many times do we want to call contains so this one and check if this is how many tiles call contains more than once are we are we going to eat or 8 over tiles and call it once per tile or we can order it over words and call it once per letter in the word OK Google where will say if the future night and when it returns false what can we do at that point so if you then we can do the next step the summing total and how many times does it have to return to the whole world what what what what is the array we want to pass and what's the character we want to pass okay so I guess they would be we know that it's possible not a minus one right yeah okay so let's let's run this week's weather tomorrow do you have any tiles and how do you want it you can hit the Run button up at the top okay actually minus one is right we just didn't update our expected results to get that did we get it yeah yeah okay all right so far we're passing a couple of test cases let's try a couple others wild card in place of the A and then in this one we would expect a -1 because we don't have enough A's actually let's put the a back in here to make it a little easier to understand what's going on in this case we still going to want a minus one because because we don't have enough eggs okay how do we how do we need to change this to start handling some of these other cases so we haven't done anything with wild cards I guess for this that contains if can we put for you right because what we're doing is we're taking a function that had a very simple idea and we're making that more complicated and then if that doesn't give us what we want we could try calling it again with an underscore it's like oh you didn't have a c okay well maybe that's fine do you have an underscore okay we can just call the function again and that keeps our our function really clean and simple and single purpose right and kind of makes it easier to test easier to debug easier to reuse I love functions are very short and simple and expressive single idea clearly okay yeah we could well is it yeah okay yeah that one right so why am I bought something we don't even expect to get to the part of the algorithm like the Step 2 online 52 we're not even expecting to get there but in fact we are getting there because we return to we need to know if we have enough of them yeah so this is where we might want to use a map or if we find something that we can use we might want to remove it from our tile bag right like once we find like oh we're going to use a c OK Google if we use a wild card okay well now we've used it we can't use it again so we need to either modify our tiles array by removing things once we've used them or we need some other strategy and here's where the map your map idea from the very beginning this may come into play because if we have a map that counts the number of tiles we have oh we have one underscore and we have one t right once we use the TV we can change that one to a 0 and now we know we don't have any more okay and that's fine okay so the bottom line is you should definitely be very comfortable with maps because that is something that comes up especially in front end development you know when you're when you're working with information can being handed to you by by a user who's actually like hammering on the app like these they come up all the all the time so you know kind of as a sort of a strategic thing definitely practice with maps the second thing is and and this is a really common common situation especially in interviews and I see people all the time take a problem before they've thoroughly understood both the problem and to understand the idea that they're about to implement in code if you don't yet understand the idea of the algorithm there is no way you're going to get the code right with any reasonable probability are you always have an idea an intention when you go to either write a function or even make a change to a single line of code your idea might not may or may not be right and that's okay right like we all right bugs from time to time but if you're not writing code with intention then it's hard to even know if what you wrote is good or not like I intend to write this okay for this reason does it do that does it get me anywhere towards my goal right now you can ask a question right and so even if it doesn't work you have the opportunity to be productive right but if you're writing code before you fully understand the problem and without intention then it's really hard to even ask yourself a question of like do I like what I have do I think this is going in a good direction because you don't have something to compare it to you don't have the line of code and that immediately tells me that that they didn't write that line with intention right because I can read the code too but what are they trying to accomplish like what is that supposed to do like why are we iterating through an array right so getting really clear with and clearly delineate the steps in your problem solving process you'll you'll make fewer mistakes and you'll actually turn what might otherwise be a mistake into an opportunity we have a limited amount of time you know to talk with each other this afternoon and you know in a real interview you know this might be the first one of four or five right so after this one like we have to be done because the next person is going to like be jumping onto the call so there is time pressure and that's real right and so there's this perception that what you better just hurry it along and write the code but if you haven't like intellectually solved the problem yet you're probably actually going to take more time because you're going to make silly mistakes all right that was the interview so I mean kudos to 10 he's still going through his current coding boot camp and he decided to take a challenge that does very very difficult so and I think he handled it really well he's a he's a humble guy and I appreciate that I think a lot of employers are going to appreciate that so good luck with your journey 10 hopefully this is helpful this was problem one out of two so we've had two people so far that haven't gotten to the second problem but we are doing one more mock interview that's going to be released in about a week from now and I'll give you a heads up this person we already recorded it this person did reach the second problem so you're going to get to see that but yeah shout out to formation I appreciate you know Daniel coming on and doing these mock interviews so yeah that's pretty much it is let me know what you think of the comments I'll see you in the next interview

welcome back to another mock interview this one's going to be a thing level mock interview formation thank you for Lending me one of your instructors Daniel who is the interviewer has been at Microsoft as a software engineer for about 10 years Facebook for about 7:00 so I think this should be a really good mock interview especially if you want to get a feel for what they're like but yeah there's two problems and we'll see how far the interviewee gets good luck all right well thanks for taking time to talk with us this morning this is going to be a lot of fun yeah yeah and I just want to make sure I'm saying your name correctly it's Milo's is that right yeah okay great so you know who you're talking to I've been an engineer for about 20 years mostly at Microsoft and then it Facebook for a long time most of my career is at those two companies on lots of different teams that was at a small a small company here in Seattle for a little while before I then I am head of instruction at a small company based out of San Francisco where a career accelerator called formation and I spend most of my time teaching and writing content and helping people become better software Engineers it's been a ton of fun relatively new at it but tell me a little more about yourself and now I'm currently looking for an employment so yeah basically a new challenge awesome of the day it sounds like JavaScript is a is an okay language for you I have things set up in JavaScript already but if we if you prefer typescript or something else take a look at the question give it a read and then ask any questions determine the point value possible for the word volume OK Google 678 there are values associated with every letter OK Google I'm wondering to myself what words can I make going to be an anagram of the word 100 I don't want you to spend your time with me what format do you want the tiles in like what type of data structure do you want them OK Google turn on the other side so if you want to just test the line like you know we actually want to write the code there okay sorry and comparing that to the weather in the Lateralus of so let's see how this goes so when will Google we don't get those three points so so the underscores come last so I could keep the track of the letters found and the remaining letters if they match the number of underscores then for example for it yeah okay of the underscore in the string so I'm not sure which solution would work better if the string is extra long then it would be looping through something else if you don't use it all the time it's even it's it's hard to remember all the little settlements like you use that every day or you kind of have to think carefully about it Natasha okay so that's what make me so yeah notice that letter values these are not the tiles themselves these are the values of the tiles so so let's just try to return just in case or or how do we know if a letter is not there right like in this case we could have a c or we could have you know so now we can make cat two ways we can make cat and we can also make underscore 80 and in this case we should return five OK Google of course it's going to be presentation so you need to add it up only if you have the character available you're just a sec for just a moment not write code let's write comments let's just write comments so let's explore the problem in a different way because you're doing it in a slow way so let's let's see if we can speed that up by not writing code so so yeah and what are the different situations when you're doing this comparison like what are the what are the different things you need to take into account let's write a simple for love I'm not that big of a fan of four Loops but might be an interesting conversation with the two of them and maybe that's a conversation so okay a little bit more and then we can it's not Optimum but we need to think about that let's play can you tell me why why would you check for the underscores in no no no we're not going to check for underscores there but can we can we make that test at 9:48 strong enough such that at 9:50 all we need to do is check for an underscore or is it strong enough already thanks so I think we can just fall down to the else block and see and check for underscores yeah so I think that test actually is strong enough availability yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah how's the weather and then where are we going to return results so the the top level thing and I see this often is that I think honestly I think there's a reason that this is a common occurrence I think people see somebody who's been doing this for a long time and they see that like you give you give somebody a problem who's like really an experienced coder and they're like oh I can just do this this and then they go and and so you get this impression that somebody who's good should just have the code at their fingertips yeah and I think that's not correct write the difference between somebody who's been doing this for a really long time and somebody who's been who has library of techniques and they're very practiced at selecting the right ones whereas somebody who's got a little bit less experience they might not have the techniques at the ready and be able to pattern match from the problem into what the right techniques are right so you have to do a little bit more you have to think a little bit more about the problem the thing is that like the steps are the same like understand the problems to apply maybe some of them work maybe some of them don't we the ones that don't work out then you're going to make a plan for how to write the code applying that technique the experienced coder is actually following all the same steps even when it appears as though they just went there previous experience my recommendation is that especially in an interview when there's you know there's some pressure or there's at least some appearance of pressure is that you should really be careful to not skip those steps because you'll you'll end up writing code too early and you'll end up having to experiment in code rather than like solving the problem intellectually and then and then writing the code and then the next thing I noticed might actually be a side effect of the first thing is that when you started writing code there were some interesting little inconsistencies one example I'm not going to judge you for not using them but if you're inconsistent it's it as the interviewer I start to ask questions right are you coding with intention right and if and if the style you're writing in has some weird inconsistencies especially at that kind of a level it makes me wonder like have you really solved the problem yet or are you just like trying to throw code at the wall and see I'm not going to judge people's style as long as it's somewhat consistent but again if you haven't solved the problem then you it's harder to code with intention and then it's hard to get those those little details right and when you're as an interview or when you're watching somebody code like it's amazing how much information I can pick up about somebody's house to make sure that the signal that you're sending to the interviewer is actually representative to what you would do when you're coding by yourself without me watching right there were other things you did hear that that seemed like yeah you you you you know our building experience towards becoming a good you know fluent coder but then there were other things that were like oh wait a minute but is this how you're going to write code every day on the job and that's and so that kind of leaves me with some questions but I think it all comes back to not actually giving yourself the time to thoroughly solve the problem intellectually first right and then everything kind of starts to come apart a little bit from their yeah I like like we ended up with a good solution you had a couple of points you were like oh I'm not quite sure if this is optimal or not how do you feel about the solution with respect to like time and space complexity now well it's not too bad hey Google okay yeah I mean so this is this ends up being a linear time linear space I think this is good so yeah I like it what did you notice about how the interview went do you have feedback for me what did ya do you have any comments stop moving forward and I want to keep learning about you so I'm always always thinking to myself what am I learning right now what am I learning right now what else do I need to learn to make a good hiring decision how do I find that out and if I let you sit there getting stuck we are both dead in the water I can't I have to figure that out yet so so I want to let you try to solve the problem right and actually sometimes I give I'll give a hint when it's completely clear to me that the candidate is is knows what they're doing like if I so I might decide hey you need help here and I want to move on to learn something else okay fine I'm going to help you I might also move the interview along if I've become completely convinced that you've got this like okay cool now I'm not learning anything anymore so let's move on to something else where I can learn which was the the values of the of the tiles right and I'm like okay you know what you need I'm going to give it to you because I don't want to sit here and wait for you to type this out right you made a decision it was clear that you kind of knew what she wanted and yeah you said you wanted an array and like I had handy a map but watching you type that out was not a valuable use of either of our time and then there were other cases you know like you know where you would have had this idea of counting underscores but we actually needed to count all the things you know and so that was a place where I was like hey wait a minute let's go back to this idea that you had previously let's expand on it right so that was the case where I was worried that you were going to kind of get stuck longer than I wanted to and so that was a chance for me to like okay no I want to keep this moving so let's go back there and revisit that idea so there's there's an example in either direction like hey you know what you need I'm going to help you along I want to speed this up and another case where like actually you need a little bit of help to move on to the next thing so I can see you write more code I'm done I can't do this you know I've actually in thousands of interviews I've actually never had that happen you know like I've had it happen in classes and teaching or like people I'm mentoring but I've never actually had that happen in an interview but you know I'm kind of a coach and teacher by Nature so you know I if somebody throws their hands up I'm like OK Google is it for in a situation where the person I'm interviewing is like clearly really bad I'll just turn it into a teaching session because Here's My Philosophy about interviewing is that I want everyone I interview to walk out of the room wanting the job I don't care how good or bad you are at the end of the interview I want you to want the job very very quickly it was clear that this person was not going to make the bar like I'm going to give you every chance to make the bar but if it's clear and you know 510 minutes that like this person is just not ready for the position that I'm interviewing them for okay let's work this through this problem together let's turn this into a coaching session you know you're going to take something away from it you're going to have a good experience you know that's better for everybody yeah yeah exactly and even if in the end I say no higher of course I would in that kind of a situation they're going to go tell their friends like oh man I interviewed with this company and I talked to this guy and this was really nice company on and giving this a shot he didn't quite get to the second problem but I think he is humble enough to handle the interview well and he received the feedback pretty well so hopefully this helped him grow but for those watching on YouTube let me know what you think in the comments and if you even want to see more interviews like this also again thank you for Lending one of your instructors for those that don't know formation essentially what I see them as is a company or can an educational program that helps people that are already in the industry that are kind of like junior-level accelerate their careers much faster when you go to their program and you know I'm pretty critical of programs but I've talked to Sophie and Michael who lead that program and they're good people the instructors are all really smart people so shout out to formation thanks again hope you enjoyed

hey everyone if you want to see what a back-end interview is like I just hosted a mock back an interview for the interviewer I invited on Scott he was my boss's boss I think sitio and then eventually became VP of engineering he manages a pretty large team right now and he has hired hundreds of Engineers he's very kind very kind-hearted and very candid which I appreciate both sides of that but we invited on Eric the brave soul who is an aspiring developer definitely with an interest in backend from what it sounds like and he decided he wanted to get a taste and feel for what a back and interview was like so I hope you like it and enjoy all right so what I like to do here is one thing about no more than 10 minutes I wanted to learn it all I gained a little bit of experience from that but I wanted to gain a bit more hands on experience and kind of do my own thing and do production code so I took the leap of faith and I decided to join a new camp boot camp which was a coding boot camp and they offered a python back-end program which I started in early October and I've been learning and growing since then great so the blockchain start you didn't have any programming experience prior to that know nothing prior to that that was pretty much my first my first language I learned wasn't actually Python and it was actually a smart contract development language called solidity and I did get a little bit you know 30 with that learned a little bit of this you know syntax but other than that nothing really major interesting one of that look like what was the learning path of that like for you was it self-driven did you have Learning Materials oh so most of it was someone tutorial base but I did play around with the production code bass a little bit so I got to you know gain a little since the land so see how the Smart Country development process goes how these contracts interact with different contracts and how it communicates with the blockchain I honestly will say it was a very valuable experience for me so solidity itself is very syntax similar to JavaScript so I mean we all know how JavaScript can be synthetically so it was definitely not the most friendliest first language to learn for sure which is why I kind of thought maybe it's time for python but that's that's where I'm at I now and would consider myself a python Maxi but I do appreciate both languages and Frameworks now have you ever seen that Meme of the the JavaScript reference manual on the JavaScript the good parts and it's like this okay I haven't seen an exact one but I feel like I've seen derivatives difficulty generating Revenue definitely difficulty with getting the right guidance and help that I needed at the moment you wear a lot of hats that's the cliche that we all hear you know and I think in the moment I was looking for a bit more guidance a bit more Hands-On a bit more you know I want to be able to do my own code I want to actually hands on the keyboard as opposed to learn this tutorial learn that tutorial and you can play around with this code base but nothing will be pushed to production that you touch so it's spelled like oh what am I really doing you know what am I actually learning so now I'm like I'm really glad I did with the boot camp and what have you done something 50 by start up in September and then I took a few weeks off and then I joined the boot camp early October and went through the going to the boot camp now right now my biggest side project I'm working on is a Spotify account so it's a truck but it's something that I really been enjoying the process of learning so I've been spending more of my time doing that and on another side project that I'm working on is also playing around with smart contract development but not with solidity it's a different it's more of a Python language called Viper and hopefully I'll be able to make my own smart contract coach base very cool just in terms of the work that you're doing getting into the application development side of things what's what are you enjoying this may sound very quickly but during those bouts of frustration and aha moments and I know that we all know those are the moments where in the in the in the midst of it you want to bash your head against the keyboard and you wonder why you got into this mess but after that that that that that light bulb goes off you you begin to realize this is why and and then you know those that you know light bulb goes off and you realize oh this is why it makes perfect sense logically synthetically but then up until that moment you know it's very frustrating but it's nothing nothing like it it's very cathartic I I can't imagine doing anything else it's such a intellectually stimulating rationalizing it's really a different way to look at the world I would say and I honestly couldn't have chosen a better career path well yeah not totally get that the point that I was about the thing that I've always enjoyed and mainly because definitely the feeling that I will always be three steps short or you know one step short or something it's never it's never the piece of technology well I mean sometimes you know but 99% of the time it's something that I did wrong I mean that I ever looked and as a perfectionist you know it's definitely difficult to let that ego go and you know just keep digging and keep me searching and keep asking for help and kind of building that kind of sense of it's okay you know you'll learn and grow from this experience whether whatever and understanding that it's all part of the Journey of learning and growing their you will never find someone that mastered a language or Master the framework everyone's learning and growing and we just comes with experience in time yeah and I don't talk about this before the confidence is the hardest thing to to build my coaching to junior level Engineers that don't work for me because I can't tell you to work outside of your work hours but to just always have a project always something always something that you're on the side because it helps to get a lot of that out of your system fast and can't disagree with you like I said I want to spend about 10 minutes just kind of having you thank we need to follow three rules each player and I gave a list of players here it's just an example Barney Wilma Fred Pebbles and Bam Bam each player and they can only so no rules on what the input looks like just that we are capable of carrying things up so whatever you're comfortable with there but what I've done here is put together a quick python example where the simplified in terms of pairs of strings and stuff you know for the Barney's to Wilma Fred gives to Betty Etc so I'm excited to do these things however you're comfortable right so otherwise I'll let you just going to get started and let me know you know what you need to go through ahead and read it to myself giving a list of players pair up players so that each player okay or whatever so my first thought is to begin with a some sort of to iterate through this list of players and to so I want to be able to somehow first categorize these players initially I was thinking about doing a some sort of so that way I can iterate through and assign each player to a different player so you know Fred with Walmart or Barneys my second thought is I could do that or I could do for first a sign this list and put it into an empty dictionary so I could do Fred Fred Fred with someone and then someone my thought process right now is going search the latter option as that could potentially help me prevent these conditions where I can then somehow have a statement that will allow me to use a dictionary and say oh if within the dictionary if Fred has already given a gift then they cannot give again to another person we have this list and so let's try that so let's have some sort of empty dictionary and so and in this Sunday dictionary I want to add all the players and assign them to a an atom to the dictionary so let's go if we can add them into the dictionary so we're putting a list and we want to return a list of couples actually so then we want to package them up into couples what would be the best way to do that let's see if you go from a list to list and you can just cast it as a couple but how would I guess that's worth a shot so you set up going with the dictionary we can take the the list so whatever the list is and then just package it up as a couple so I wouldn't call it my couple and we'll pass it as a couple and once it's Castle randomly so think about this in terms of complex is a real game right obviously this is software so we can cheat a little bit here at certain points but this is an actual game we got a whole bunch of names and a half right theoretically we have that here too it's within the players and then the actual game is you got Barney Walmart's the first person in the circle Barney we just start by emulating that experience players picking names out of a hat let me order Superfluous like I said we can see this isn't a real game and it's it's just software so I mean we have a list of players they're in an order the order just happens to be the order that I typed them in here but can we can we replicate the process of each other right so we still want to be able to iterate through the list of players so for every player in for every player in the list of players you want to be able to choose one of them so let's say we so we're entering through the list of players and we want to I guess a sign each player with another player so so the next thing we need to do that with a randomized name out and get something random we could we could choose we could just have it somehow we could use like a random function like that would select out of the list just a random number with a net list so somehow like somehow make it so that it will pick the first one on the list or the third one in the list I do not remember there's a million mechanisms so I guess kind of going back to my original give us a number and then we could use the the random module the random integer and then select a random number which will be assigned to a different random player within the list so if I'm visualizing this correctly we have five keys in this example of Barney gets a four wheeler gets a one zero just kind of random into within that list and then so now implementing it so you can so from the first to so we first want to get the dictionary and then we also want to attend everything in the players list two dictionary so just do it again baby selected individual now to have that randomly selected individual be assigned to a specific player number now we just need to assign the randomly chosen player to a list solution only choose this if the Eagles so I guess we could do something like where we go within dictionary we could do something like this where we have a specific index numbers can uniquely assign those numeric values to the keys with the dictionary then we know which index in the input list is the pair right I agree with that approach that certainly solves the problem I think that the challenge that I see initially probably should think through next is because if I kind of like a little bit the dictionary and then for each player we're going to appendix there and then you're going to sign that value but what happens if Rand choice prevent that from happening so if Ryan's choice I guess maybe something we would have to okay so from the dictionary.com we pretty much have to ensure uniqueness throughout so I guess so in the first generation but other people as well so if my choice I was chosen so I guess the question then becomes what the I guess I'll have to use the dictionary from the dictionary if it's easier after the random number is chosen what's the weather we can you know is we're entering through the list of players we got two problems first how can we solve for that one or is there an easy way we could solve for that one just by virtue of iterating through the list and knowing what position we're then it should take that out of the available choices so part of it is that would be zero has been given a gift now all right we're ensuring the uniqueness of Point number one by iterating through the list one by one that's and so everybody gives a gift once in terms of 0.005 can get both values and and then if we do that then we can access the players index so if the brand choice is equal to the same index of the players so for example if the first iteration of someone and it will hit this way if 0 is equal to sew in the players and is equal to the first iteration now we should somehow now have skip over Fred for the next iteration Wellness in his first pass right first execution of the loop only one iteration Happening Here in the first value is Fred the index is Zero's into a hat he pulls out zero or in other words I'm going to pick that up I'm glad you know but again so if we're passing on the circle then really each person gets one turn if you will and using Fred as an example without that choice so so if we want him to pick it out again and doing that is essentially here right so but then start time his name is not included in the Box for that use case but let's think about another use case now sure and then you're on the right path here but I think we just need to kind of restructure that the control flow here Fred pulling his name on the first try it's a possibility it's going to happen yeah it's the first index in that from from Ranchos then it's no longer an issue but what if it happens on Wilma at the window just run those two lines of code again believe could be just continuing me but I think that would be the next time that's right let's see so the same add right and then potentially so what I would change here would be simply this so wow that's the case cuz I want to it over the list of players again it's not really necessary in this case is picking the name now we have a name who's not me now I've satisfied points number one because going around Circle points number three because I'm not giving a receiving to yourself which means now we have the second bullet receiving gifts more than once so me just change this here to the logic is the same and so if you're exiting here so let's say Fred shoes at so fresh juices Fred and keep choosing again and once he has chosen someone that's not Fred then we'll have chosen let's say 1:00 and he will how do we determine dictionary that we can get it right over the keys in the dictionary to get a name and the value of each one of those keys is going to be an index how can we ensure as we pick a new name or a new index to sign to a name I can make sure that that name is that index has never been pulled before so you can check the index do something I have to take that number continue working while I'm picking myself or I'm picking somebody who's already picked before right and that's that if statement that you're typing out there how do we determine that somebody has been picked up before the randomly chosen number has is equal to the the the the the key value in the dictionary then that means it has been chosen yeah so just iterate over the dictionary and look to see everything about you before if yes can't receive another gift so that we can't be chosen again yes if they're present in that dictionary because we have selected before as a valid selection and that that should effectively ruled out right so using example so two isn't signed up Freddy have to but we can't give to to Barney again because that index is already been used up that does solve the problem and it's actually completely and I didn't pick somebody who's already picked before that or satisfying the other two constraints of the game and this is happening at random what would happen though if the last name in The List in this case Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam has not given a gift yet but also been hasn't received a gift yet so the only name left in the list is bad bad what's going to happen to this program when you hit that case what would happen if that were the case so bam bam bam bam bam bam I see so then we I guess we should probably put logic in so that it's removed from the list but I feel like that's not the that's such a Brute Force way to prevent that from happening like the way to go but I wouldn't wouldn't remove it from the most right and it's one of those cases where it's not an even or odd thing it's always going to happen additional that way it kind of ensures that bam bam will likely be able to have picked someone that you know he can receive a gift and give it to and the other two can keep going until they're able to get someone that's that way bamboo is included as well that would be my thought process brute force and like I said performance doesn't matter that's not the question right on the rules yeah I think the other way too and this is where the difference of software versus real world comes into play as you can really just cheat and just swap with somebody else right cuz nobody else what questions can I ask for you I would definitely say points of areas of improvement kind of my thought process what would be a better way to approach just general questions such as these I feel like it's difficult to understand to First comprehend the full problem at hand with the constraints into account without fumbling and you know running into education which is like the better way to approach that yeah and I don't say I've this is one that I've retired several years ago because I did it for like 10 years straight but having seen you know 100 people are all over the map in terms of how they approach the problem and it's a hard problem right and the reason I've always on the scale of folks who are very new to getting into programming versus folks who are very mature I've ever seen your level they solve it a very different ways and and me as an interview gives me a lot of insights that I can calibrate against you know for how different folks approach it but I think in general in terms of the feedback there's I think definitely confidence in data structures is an area that I would focus I think this is where I kind of interjected early on is is a bit thinking about the data structure to use to track who's getting what spending have the amount of time on that which is really kind of just stems from that lack of confidence in technical tools right now I'm going to use a for Loop here I'm going to use a dictionary here those kinds of things it does start to become second nature and you start to see a lot of the caveats very quickly the reason I bring up the Bam Bam scenario here at the end which candidates on that part right that's the question because it's an opportunity in every case where you can debug a problem but as long as we get to the answer that was really helpful I think for myself just a small comment is so focused on the the end goal as opposed to the the journey with problems like this I think that's really kind of the challenge is kind of really focusing on not more of the syntax or the tools because I mean like the different data structures and algorithms like they're just you know means to an end right and the actual like you were saying so I think that's great feedback thank you honestly it was very helpful and very definitely a lot of fun for sure a lot definitely push give me the right direction and definitely showing me the logic in a more friendlier way than than necessary sometimes it seems like I was simply pulled the answer which you know not 14 or anything but it seems like it was kind of like being kind of like guided toward which is you know definitely helpful but I guess in hindsight I would say it would definitely be okay to kind of have myself or whoever to struggle a bit more I guess just to kind of go through that you know phase of frustration to get those aha moments that's just be my only two the nursing home in one where I'm kind of undecided on because you know the reason I've developed that habit over the years and just sort of energy people in the right direction is for me it's candidate experience right you want don't want somebody to come away and say like a company suck the interview at the same time like as the interviewer you need something that's going to be challenging and go find the right Talent that's that's that's that's why you get the balance right now I am not in the popular crowd of technical interviewers who prefer the the Whiteboard what would your preference be would it be towards being coached into the end solution and to get through a successful completion whether or not or would you prefer that if we had ended at a point where like you only saw two or three of the bullets we didn't sell everything alright I I even though cuz I think through those moments of frustration even if you're not completing I think I would say having gone through it it seems like the end goal isn't you know isn't the shouldn't be the main focus of the main priority none of this code will be you know for Pride right so it's not like we're going to you know we're trying to make like the most clever algorithm on the spot it's I guess kind of trying to determine you know that's all process and the bigger picture overall so I would say my my my my my opinion would be that even having a more challenging question that forces the interviewer or the interviewing sorry to struggle and to go through those moments of frustration would be more insightful ultimately for the interviewer okay that's why I will thank you I will say Anderson the point very positive aspect that you know one of the things I'm always looking at and a lot of candidates come down to this point is you ask questions or you nudge in certain ways and give feedback in certain ways to see how somebody receives that feedback and nudging and prodding in here was was a bit touching on that and you were very welcoming to that which for anybody no matter how you are on your career that's exactly what you want to see and then Central co-worker is somebody who yeah we can have a conversation and they're not going to get angry at you or something like that when you you suggest one thing or the other you know right righteous and I thought it went really well remember this I have what is a most people are willing to they're already scared of going to an interview and they're definitely not willing to hop on cameras so seriously kudos to Eric for doing this this is phenomenal and you know I feel like I feel like I could almost empathize with Eric I am someone that still gets nervous and interviews and I think a lot of you can advertise as well but you know I think you did a great job working through those problems and you know this is his first interview is really cool to see him grow from this and we even got to have a conversation privately afterwards but I think Eric's going to do very well with his career but let me know in the comments below if you're watching this on video definitely let me know in the comments if you're watching it on audio there's going to be a link to our Discord server you could just hop in and let me know there or how to the video but either way I want to know what you thought of this I'm super curious
