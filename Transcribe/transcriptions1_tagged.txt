okay I miss you so very much how about you yes I'm also doing great thank you I have seen your profile so it seems to be very feasible for the current position and I wish it would be great if you can walk me through five listen to to get give the meaningful information to the heart dataset so any of the projects you are associated with English so I was associated with one of the project where we used to find out the export data for one of the photos Facebook where I have to find the insights about the export of coffee from India to European countries so we have a list of 10 to 15 companies which we have to find out okay what are their profit margins and what are there was the selling price is about the about that particular product period they are lacking and what are the countries that they should Target about from Europe where they can have a good profit margin from they can get a good Revenue out of it so this was my project in the last 20 years or so in the company great so all right so what's your business full stop if you can give me a task and you give me a deadline I'm ready to give me that deadlines so I'm very hardworking person third is I am open to any kind of Learning Center so if you are giving me a new opportunity in any of the technology which I am not having a good knowledge of so I'm hoping to learn that technology in a specified time so that I can improve and grow as per the company States so let's jump into the question tell me how do you handle missing days in order to find missing value of missing volume settings so first of all we have to go to the particular source of providing the data so as to find out okay please tell me what is this message something which has been missed if you can Rectify it then it is fine other than that we have some of the tools that are used in power bi as well as in Python where we use some of the functions to fill that missing values like in Python we use backflow of forward we use mean Max mode whatever the particular set of or whatever the business account as per the business requirements we feel those missing backwards so it's a part of our particular database according to the business need and as per after speaking to our manager or the data Provider from The Source from which state is coming after a discussion with them we particularly handle accordingly so on a scale of 108 so what states are I would rate around 8:45 8815 so let's get started today and how can you create one so sorry do you have any understanding what are indexes indexes are used to retrieve the data in a secret in a very much faster than two types of indexes like a cluster index in Augustus cluster index what's the date and a sequential order like if you have to retrieve faster we use cluster in text where is cluster index whenever we Define a primary key in a table the cluster index automatically it gets injected whereas in non-clustered index it's not the primary key is the unique who is a which is the differentiator over there so as I told that cluster and non-clustered in Texas okay so how they improve query performance okay because it is sorted okay so it's very easy because if you talk about non Plus in the case of our books so we have indexes suppose we have to read some of the chapter in that particular book we go go to the next part we see which page number this particular chapter is and then we go to that particular page number and read that chapter okay likewise is in the sequel as well suppose I have to retrieve the data from let's say let's say it's a employee ID 3D data and select everything from employee table where the employee ID is equal to 3 so this is the part of index say okay so that is the record which I want to fetch and that is possible with the help of index so how do you use a case statement in sequence statements if I have to find some of the requirements or I can say some cases are there suppose I want to find those records where the salary range is between 20,000 to 50000 those persons report so in that case we can use case statement as well or some some way to filter the data in order to fetch the date can you please provide me some example of using case for conditioning logic in star from Obama is when Saturday is greater than 50,000 then give that employee then name that particular column as employees with salary greater than 50,000 of the create another attribute in particular sequel record so as to just segregate the details with the help of cases coming to the next question Define me what do you understand by the term or the concept what is the concept of normalization and sous vide do we do a create a partitioning of the table of we create that particular table into a subset of tables okay so that process is called normalization and what about denomination again from just the reverse of normalization is a reverse of normalization sure I'm not pretty sure it's a temporary use in a particular query in the particular scenario and it's just it's just an alternative to use a Subway Surf City we create a temporary table and with we can reuse that particular table in our particular car in that area as well multiple times so this is called cities so that's the end from SQL so how would you rate yourself on a scale of 10 for power 7777 tell me the difference between dietary so important and added the two main motivational from the sources import mode we are completely and taking the date that means data from particular sources we are just injecting the whole table into a particular power bi desktop where is we in the direct query where establishing a connection between a power bi and a particular source that is equal to or any of the source postgame is equal in the database so these these this is a major difference between a important directions most of the visualization tools are applicable in the import mode which are not applicable in the DirecTV remote okay and it's easy to use it's easy because the query performance is also very high in the in the import mode where is the query performance is low in the directory mode Dax expression doesn't work in the direct query mode and most of the some of the visuals doesn't work doesn't support very much so let's say that you have to create and use for calculated columns and measures in baby so how are you going to do that so calculated columns are used when the when we have to evaluate a calculation in that case and it is also known as row context where is if your evaluate if you are getting the aggregate evaluation of the data then in that case we are using matches and it is ya suppose if you if I have to calculate revenue and that Revenue would be calculated aggregating in that case I would be using message suppose now I have to calculate the price of any commodity or of any product and then in that particular table I have a unit price of that particular commodity and as well as I have to quantity of that particular commodity so in that case we cannot use measures we have to use because he will have the means different unit price and the and the quantity sold so in that case we would be using calculated columns where is if you have to sum of the whole particular quantity sold or if you have to some of the whole price of the particular products then we can use measures so have you come across tax yes so how do you implement time intelligence in power bi using that so sorry for the functions that that we use as a Time intelligence period so tell me the key components of a power bill reporters and the tables cancel cancel so tell me how do you add power be reports and dashboard with others so sorry my understanding have not shared the report because I'm not given the opportunity to share with you period in terms of 10 so I would rate around 6:00 in 5668 so let's get started okay so my first question is how would you use Python to automate data extraction from various apis and combine the data for analysis and with the help of some of the functions like we can use to to merge the data into the particular settings so last question explain how would you use Python to detect and handle and only in a data set what are the techniques and libraries would you employ python for example if you have a data set so first and foremost thing is to find the missing value and then we have to find that the data is having a proper Integrity or Not by having the proper sense of details so we handle the missing value we followed the function like we see so that we can find that data isn't proper structure so these are the steps that we use in Python to work with some other team okay how soon you can grab stuff you know new technology so if I have given a chance to work with you so sorry give me the chance to learn any of the new tools so how soon you can get I can be ready in around 14 to 20 days max volume where do you see yourself in the next 5 years I want to grow into the systems of first of all the present company only I want to be to a topmost position with new learnings so that I can help others as well if I mean going to newcomers in the industry so in that in order to help you have to gain more and more knowledge and I want to be on that position and and how can manage it from the person like that I mean how can you do that in spite of having multiple projects and Target lines so what do you see nothing but how you systematically maintain your voice so whatever the task has been given to you on a daily basis on an hourly basis in an organization you have to maintain that particular you have to complete that task in particular deadline is because they are dealing with us they are just keep on piling up their work and that is where they are lagging if you're maintaining that work if you are stuck somewhere else Wells Fargo with that ambition thank you for joining today's podcast so we'll get back to you with the feedback again okay have a great day and all the very best thank you
