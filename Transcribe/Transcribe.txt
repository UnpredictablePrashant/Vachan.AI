okay I miss you so very much how about you yes I'm also doing great thank you I have seen your profile so it seems to be very feasible for the current position and I wish it would be great if you can walk me through five listen to to get give the meaningful information to the heart dataset so any of the projects you are associated with English so I was associated with one of the project where we used to find out the export data for one of the photos Facebook where I have to find the insights about the export of coffee from India to European countries so we have a list of 10 to 15 companies which we have to find out okay what are their profit margins and what are there was the selling price is about the about that particular product period they are lacking and what are the countries that they should Target about from Europe where they can have a good profit margin from they can get a good Revenue out of it so this was my project in the last 20 years or so in the company great so all right so what's your business full stop if you can give me a task and you give me a deadline I'm ready to give me that deadlines so I'm very hardworking person third is I am open to any kind of Learning Center so if you are giving me a new opportunity in any of the technology which I am not having a good knowledge of so I'm hoping to learn that technology in a specified time so that I can improve and grow as per the company States so let's jump into the question tell me how do you handle missing days in order to find missing value of missing volume settings so first of all we have to go to the particular source of providing the data so as to find out okay please tell me what is this message something which has been missed if you can Rectify it then it is fine other than that we have some of the tools that are used in power bi as well as in Python where we use some of the functions to fill that missing values like in Python we use backflow of forward we use mean Max mode whatever the particular set of or whatever the business account as per the business requirements we feel those missing backwards so it's a part of our particular database according to the business need and as per after speaking to our manager or the data Provider from The Source from which state is coming after a discussion with them we particularly handle accordingly so on a scale of 108 so what states are I would rate around 8:45 8815 so let's get started today and how can you create one so sorry do you have any understanding what are indexes indexes are used to retrieve the data in a secret in a very much faster than two types of indexes like a cluster index in Augustus cluster index what's the date and a sequential order like if you have to retrieve faster we use cluster in text where is cluster index whenever we Define a primary key in a table the cluster index automatically it gets injected whereas in non-clustered index it's not the primary key is the unique who is a which is the differentiator over there so as I told that cluster and non-clustered in Texas okay so how they improve query performance okay because it is sorted okay so it's very easy because if you talk about non Plus in the case of our books so we have indexes suppose we have to read some of the chapter in that particular book we go go to the next part we see which page number this particular chapter is and then we go to that particular page number and read that chapter okay likewise is in the sequel as well suppose I have to retrieve the data from let's say let's say it's a employee ID 3D data and select everything from employee table where the employee ID is equal to 3 so this is the part of index say okay so that is the record which I want to fetch and that is possible with the help of index so how do you use a case statement in sequence statements if I have to find some of the requirements or I can say some cases are there suppose I want to find those records where the salary range is between 20,000 to 50000 those persons report so in that case we can use case statement as well or some some way to filter the data in order to fetch the date can you please provide me some example of using case for conditioning logic in star from Obama is when Saturday is greater than 50,000 then give that employee then name that particular column as employees with salary greater than 50,000 of the create another attribute in particular sequel record so as to just segregate the details with the help of cases coming to the next question Define me what do you understand by the term or the concept what is the concept of normalization and sous vide do we do a create a partitioning of the table of we create that particular table into a subset of tables okay so that process is called normalization and what about denomination again from just the reverse of normalization is a reverse of normalization sure I'm not pretty sure it's a temporary use in a particular query in the particular scenario and it's just it's just an alternative to use a Subway Surf City we create a temporary table and with we can reuse that particular table in our particular car in that area as well multiple times so this is called cities so that's the end from SQL so how would you rate yourself on a scale of 10 for power 7777 tell me the difference between dietary so important and added the two main motivational from the sources import mode we are completely and taking the date that means data from particular sources we are just injecting the whole table into a particular power bi desktop where is we in the direct query where establishing a connection between a power bi and a particular source that is equal to or any of the source postgame is equal in the database so these these this is a major difference between a important directions most of the visualization tools are applicable in the import mode which are not applicable in the DirecTV remote okay and it's easy to use it's easy because the query performance is also very high in the in the import mode where is the query performance is low in the directory mode Dax expression doesn't work in the direct query mode and most of the some of the visuals doesn't work doesn't support very much so let's say that you have to create and use for calculated columns and measures in baby so how are you going to do that so calculated columns are used when the when we have to evaluate a calculation in that case and it is also known as row context where is if your evaluate if you are getting the aggregate evaluation of the data then in that case we are using matches and it is ya suppose if you if I have to calculate revenue and that Revenue would be calculated aggregating in that case I would be using message suppose now I have to calculate the price of any commodity or of any product and then in that particular table I have a unit price of that particular commodity and as well as I have to quantity of that particular commodity so in that case we cannot use measures we have to use because he will have the means different unit price and the and the quantity sold so in that case we would be using calculated columns where is if you have to sum of the whole particular quantity sold or if you have to some of the whole price of the particular products then we can use measures so have you come across tax yes so how do you implement time intelligence in power bi using that so sorry for the functions that that we use as a Time intelligence period so tell me the key components of a power bill reporters and the tables cancel cancel so tell me how do you add power be reports and dashboard with others so sorry my understanding have not shared the report because I'm not given the opportunity to share with you period in terms of 10 so I would rate around 6:00 in 5668 so let's get started okay so my first question is how would you use Python to automate data extraction from various apis and combine the data for analysis and with the help of some of the functions like we can use to to merge the data into the particular settings so last question explain how would you use Python to detect and handle and only in a data set what are the techniques and libraries would you employ python for example if you have a data set so first and foremost thing is to find the missing value and then we have to find that the data is having a proper Integrity or Not by having the proper sense of details so we handle the missing value we followed the function like we see so that we can find that data isn't proper structure so these are the steps that we use in Python to work with some other team okay how soon you can grab stuff you know new technology so if I have given a chance to work with you so sorry give me the chance to learn any of the new tools so how soon you can get I can be ready in around 14 to 20 days max volume where do you see yourself in the next 5 years I want to grow into the systems of first of all the present company only I want to be to a topmost position with new learnings so that I can help others as well if I mean going to newcomers in the industry so in that in order to help you have to gain more and more knowledge and I want to be on that position and and how can manage it from the person like that I mean how can you do that in spite of having multiple projects and Target lines so what do you see nothing but how you systematically maintain your voice so whatever the task has been given to you on a daily basis on an hourly basis in an organization you have to maintain that particular you have to complete that task in particular deadline is because they are dealing with us they are just keep on piling up their work and that is where they are lagging if you're maintaining that work if you are stuck somewhere else Wells Fargo with that ambition thank you for joining today's podcast so we'll get back to you with the feedback again okay have a great day and all the very best thank you

hello hello good morning yes tell me something about yourself so first of all thank you so much for giving me this opportunity so my name is and I am from Pune and I've completed my Bachelor's in Business Administration and international business coming to my hobbies like to play guitar for sale so now we are doing the mock interview okay so tell me what is the primary key the primary key is a key that is a unique key which can only be one in a table and it cannot be a null value good can we put more than one primary key in a table know that can only be one primary care okay is it possible to drop primary key yes we can okay so do you have command about what is the foreign key is used to combine tables can be more than one and it can accept is it possible to delete data from parent table if the data is existing in childhood no we can't get an error okay so anything else if you want to delete the data from parent table that is the existing in childhood yes we can delete the data for sleep from the child table then it is possible to delete the data from the primary table okay good you have mentioned the joints do you have do you have practice on that joints okay so just tell me about the joints first okay okay do you have the cross what is the internet how many values from the left and it will include all the values from right okay what about right outside the values from the right table common values from right table and it will include all the values from left table as well okay so can we say the laptop charger everything from left and coming from right okay and what about full outage okay okay is it possible to join do joints in a 3152 view a table multiple which can be Select Staff from table name where the salary is in range of 50,000 and 60,000 instead of writing this in an entire way such a long code I can just put it inside of you and I can just call that you by saying select star from the view that I have just created so that will make things more easy and faster okay is it possible is it the table and view is having same road ID know they have different okay do you have the material OK Google according to you just correct me the table and metalize you is having same different Road ID is it take MetLife view physical space yes it will take physical space is it possible DML in Naturalizer okay no problem turn off view what is the Google Ok Google what is the size that is used as a reference today's date as a reference in the data okay so can you tell me the aggregate functions okay what is the command of the total salary in a table so we can do that some of celery and the command select star from sum of salary you should aware about that okay no problem so what is the difference between where and having a few differences so having can be used only with Group by the group by where is where it can be used anywhere and having we need to use aggregate functions along with having whereas in case of faster because it faces data specifically using aggregate functions is not that faster good what is the difference between delete we can delete only specific rules trunk it will delete everything okay delete 12 / delete we can delete the all records okay which one is faster drunk it is faster okay okay everything is okay so so we are giving to some questions just try to solve on your laptop okay how to find second maximum salary in a tablet just show me okay good so just show me you have mentioned some table just display that table I need it to fix the speaker can we fix the maximum salary in a group yes just right just writing that I guess you needed to find out the maximum salary in a group right now so whatever maximum salary I want to display the maximum salary you what what is my knowledge level so where do you think I should increase my knowledge or if there are any specific pointers which will help me to get good skills to be acquired in your company okay the most important thing your confidence is good that is the most I guess you are doing the first time the mock interview and you belong to no on it and everything is okay somewhere you like somewhere because of the practice and in here whatever we have given you got it and you are doing so do more practice and whenever you can shut it down and do the practice in front of the mirror mirror and some people are there in front of you and again try to keep interviews and check it you will become come as soon as because the shortly you can reach their the next time whenever you do a video interviews can we come to more complex questions okay so all the best

all right so this is a mock interview with Rishi popteenie Rishi has close to 10 years of experience working in the capital markets domain as a programmer analyst and as a business analyst and the purpose of our conversation today is to get to know reshy a little bit better and to understand some of the experiences that he's had as a business analyst so with that said welcome Rishi to the mock interview thank you thank you very much all right so I wish you would like to do is kind of I've had a chance to go through your resume and I see that you do have quite a bit of experience in the domain that is being interviewed for what I like for us to do is to really just kind of get to know each other a little bit and then we'll just dive into the the contents of your real estate a little bit more so I'm wondering if we can start that off with you just play me a little bit about yourself so as you pointed out I have over 9 years of experience as a business analyst most of it has been in the Capital Market space in my most recent project I was working with one of the leading investment banks in Europe and I was part of that I bought implementation I was the lead business analyst for a software that was responsible for the submission of interest rate benchmarks on a daily basis so the bank that I was working for is on the panel that makes regular submissions to Benchmark administrators and that's why this the software is not only critical from a functional or an operational perspective it has reputational risks associated with it as well as absolutely so that seems like that's seems like very it seems like one of those types of projects where there's a lot of pressure to make sure they're not any major mistakes especially with reputational risk we'll get into your experiences as a as a lead business analyst a little bit a little bit later on so that's a that's a great interview that's a great first answer to that question can you kind of just give me a little bit of an overview of the throughout all of the projects that you've been through you know there are certain types of projects where you can be on where things tend to go very smoothly and undoubtedly if you're involved in any kind of IT project you're always going to be involved in a project where things don't go as smoothly for your own experience is have you had any situations where things haven't gone as smoothly and can you talk a little bit about some of the things that you did in that project yes the way I look at it I am only able to make a living because things don't go smoothly because if they did I mostly people like me wouldn't be required I don't mean to be a firefighter but what I'm trying to say is what kind of work that business analysts do is fraught with ambiguity right so and the risk is even more when the when the project deal with a really important things like I bought submission or the implementation of a major regulatory platform like message to sew on a on a regular basis I'm faced with typical issues that business analyst face for example difficult or recalcitrant stakeholders people I would just take holders who are not clear exactly on what they want they know why they're doing something in some cases not even that but mostly I've been lucky enough to work with stakeholders who got the business drivers sorted out but they it becomes very difficult for them to prioritize their needs so that's frequent Challenge and those deck keep moving up and down right so that's something I have to deal with secondly being at the Crux of the development process a software development process I have to deal with development teams with QA professionals deployment professionals devops guys and all of these guys have their own timelines their own agendas and in a lot of cases their own motivations so to balance all of these right that is something that is common that that's something I've experienced in all my projects so I would say that these two are I would say yeah these two other the biggest challenges that in general have faced in my career yeah that's actually great because that answer kind of really your experience really shows through in that answer because what I'm hearing there is that you what's the experiences where you're dealing with a lot of stakeholders who are not totally clear about their own needs first of all you'll have oftentimes stakeholders and organizations where you'll have the stakeholders that you have on your own project or going to have competing needs you'll experience those types of situations on a lot of projects and what I've also noticed in what you're saying here is that you actually have full life cycles implementation experience because if you're working with the devops teams for example that typically means that you are working to move things from one and to another and so you're not just doing the up front business analysis work you're actually working full life cycle lacrosse the entire development life cycle and delivery process which is which is very good just like cycling back to the idea of working with stakeholders who have let's say very unclear needs do you can you talk to us a little bit about you're approaches to dealing with a stakeholder who is when you're dealing with much more seniors stakeholders who are at the Strategic level a lot of times they have a good sense of the direction that they want the organization to go in and they understand their own business needs at a high level can you talk to us a little bit about what you do with stakeholders like that to help them understand what their more detailed requirements might be and to help them kind of clarify their own understanding of what it is that they need operationally what happens with family senior people is that as you said they know of very vaguely what they want but they're not quite sure how to go about and in some cases they might have a set of priorities that's right I used successfully in the past are there is a set of prioritization techniques so there is something called the hundred dollar technique so hypothetically speak to them first list out say the top five or six things that you want to do brainstorm I will not count a question anything that you say let's just write down whatever you whatever comes out of your mouth and then if I give you $100 right now and ask you to spend it on just the top four out of these five or six what would be the amount that you would allocate each of those four and which ones would you leave out that sort of gives me an idea of what what they are subconsciously prioritizing but not able to probably get through immediately that's one second is we use something called Quality Function deployment it's something that is very time-consuming and that's why it's used only when your traditional approach is don't don't have so things like let's do what's benefit analysis so if you do something what is the benefit that you are going to get versus what is the risk of the loss that you face if you don't do it right so a combination of these two things often helps us to prioritize if to take it further what we what I often do is get some technical Personnel involved and add to this makes the level of technical risk involved so feasibility with respect to resources that are available that's also important which helps us sort of get a very good handle on what needs to be tackled first yeah and I think that's a very it's a very effective prioritization technique that you use to basically give somebody a certain amount of credit and say you know what what things do you really want because when you force a person to really have to allocate those Victorian you know credits then you really get force them to kind of think that think through their own what is in a in a very in a very clear way which is which is very good now let's imagine a scenario where we have let's say two director-level stakeholders on your project and you're really spearheading the scoping of the project and you're doing the business requirements and now these two directors have a very different priorities of what they want from you and let's say we have an example where there's one director who is really looking for a certain feature in the product that you're looking to deliver but another one of our directors who is on the same project has a very strong objections to expanding the resources needed to deliver that product to deliver that feature in the product and they are really trying to get their own items on to the list ahead of the priority if you're faced with the situation like that what are some of the things that you can do to help resolve that situation yeah so I faced a similar situation not not exactly the same because frankly I've never had the fortune slash Misfortune of dealing with two directors at the same time but yeah pretty Senior People representing competing into groups so there was just on my last project where are on the eyeball implementation there are two groups that are constantly loggerheads because of the nature of the work that they're supposed to do one is the group that is responsible for getting the submissions out on time the second is our internal surveillance group who will do anything to slow things down so as to minimize the risk of erroneous submissions now you can probably imagine why these two guys are all these two groups are always at Cross purposes right so there was a feature where the submission team had wanted a copy from yesterday feature so figures that was submitted yesterday could be submitted and he was he was really adamant that we should have it but the when this when these features were taken to the surveillance group for the validation they were up in arms they didn't want this they said that if the team is getting paid every day they should be using their brains every day to come up with numbers the software is helping them to do that copy from yesterday is not a good future for several reasons so obviously arbitration is the first approach I tried to get them on the same table and speak about it but when he became clear that there was not going to work and I don't clean the credit for this one of my report is suggested this we support the idea and we put it to both parties the idea was that the submission team would be able to copy from yesterday but they would be able to do that only a certain number of times a week and and the number of times that they will be able to do that during the week would be controlled by the surveillance team depending on the depending on the periods of stress for the bank and so in that experience that you find that both of the parties were I don't want to say happy but where they both willing to go along with with that suggestion yes and they actually want to my support in it and I was really happy that both parties got something out of it not exactly what they wanted but yeah that was one recent example of how we dealt with competing requirements that's excellent and it's good to hear that you have stakeholder groups negotiating in the way that you in that case because oftentimes you'll find that when there are those types of competing priorities a lot of times the two sides can't come together and they can't really agree on a solution that's as Innovative as as the one that your team delivered so that's it's great now let's just imagine the center that same scenario but let's say we didn't have that Innovative Solution on the table and we just really couldn't get the two teams to agree would there be another approach in your mind and handling that situation if that hadn't worked I had only one thing in mind I was going to escalate this to my manager and ask him to arbitrate because he was more likely to be listened to and this might seem like a vanilla solution but to be honest thing that I could have thought of was in in our project right it's all revenue driven so sometimes simple question of who's paying for the future right so if someone is paying for the future and they're ready to have it delivered and it's it's the burden of not executing the future due to sort of an audit Step Falls on the surveillance team then I would tell them look take it up with the other team or your superiors if he produces feature and then later then at least it's not in our bucket yeah yeah that's good and I think that the last option to escalate is always the option that we have to fall back on a lot of times as business analyst when we've tried everything else you've tried all the Innovative approaches that you can take and you're still saying that you're stakeholders are really not able to come to some sort of an agreement then it seems like a lot of times those escalation paths need to exist in the organization and your ability to escalate through your own chain of management as usually the right way to to get those things results that's so that's great I want to touch a little bit on your experience in working with the development and the infrastructure teams in across the different projects that you've been on so software developers tend to have a very unique I would say a disposition and they tend to have their own way of working and in most organizations that's the case but in projects where you're really developing or you're enhancing these Michelle Mission critical systems like the ones that you've had experience working that have massive reputational liabilities possibly attached to them in those types of situations the developers tend to have very very high standards and they have tend to have very high expectations of the analysts that they work with and so can you speak a little bit to your experiences with that yes I would say that I've been lucky we have to work with some really good developers and because they're very good at what they do they expect the same level of competence from everyone around them that is generally been the case but if I had to pick one situation it was my method to implementation right now that was a very high pressure regulatory program that had a hard stop because the regulation went live on the 3rd of January 2018 so there was no sort of negotiation we had to get it done there was a piece on instrument data determination which was really complex and the developers were they they had they had no idea of the complexity but they were they worked very closely with me to to identify what exactly needed to be done it was sort of a symbiotic process because I needed to understand the feasibility of what what I was going to propose so I worked very closely with them and there was a there was a very closed feedback loop all the time so go back to the to the requirement owners take the requirements from them give to the developers check doable check feasible Etc if and and because of this we managed to to implement or deliver a very crucial piece of functionality whereby the developers also found a part of the solution so they were not just writing code but they felt like equally vested stakeholders right from the beginning because their voice was heard very often I've seen projects where even when in some of my ears where I was working with senior beers and they would treat two ways or development professional as separate teams and sort of develop silos in their own heads but I have to avoid that and I've seen that it really helps okay good that's good because those like you said in many organizations some business analysts will oftentimes just treat them as a separate team not really doing a whole lot of consultation as their determining the business needs and writing their functional specifications and they will sometimes only consult the development team right at the back end when they think they have everything ready and not getting that development feedback right up front with a lot of what you're producing can oftentimes create problems for you down the line that you're not going to be able to see so making sure that the development team is looped in all throughout especially for very complex things where a lot of times the development teams themselves will have a lot of questions that the analysts might not necessarily have thought of so having that regular interaction with them and making them feel like they've been heard that they're concerns have been heard is very important for developers especially in this domain so just looking at your resume here so it seems here that you have a bit of a programming background as well so you started off your career initially as a programmer analyst yeah that's right okay and so you would you say that in the domain that you're in that your development background helps you in in some ways or do you think that that's something that's that's just coincidental I would say it's a very important thing it's a it's a great asset two ways so when is first two things I wanted to be in the industry but not in this world I saw that I'm most suited to that so it helped me in my choice of career so that's their of course and having written code for a bit and I still write code in some forms so sequel a bit of python so that helps me understand how they think of problems and solutions so in terms of data structures right in terms of how data would be transmitted stored viewed what could be the Practical difficulties with something that I am proposing so I can't just say you know what is the requirement to go do it it's not my problem so yeah it does help me because I've been on the other side for a bit okay that's great going back to your experiences as a team lead now let's say if we were in the process of launching a new project that we estimated we need five total analysts for and it was in an area that you have strong domain knowledge in in that situation do you think that really not really knowing anything about any of the other endless that are on your team would you see yourself more as a team member initiative like that or would you see yourself as more of a team what is the official position so it could be that the four other the five other analysts are working with me are equally experienced and are equally talented and there is no clear demarcation as to who's going to report to home that's one way of looking at it secondly pieces of work that will be that we are assigned individually obviously at some point we would sit around the table and and share what we're going to do and how to do it share each other's piece of work if it became clear that those pieces are pretty independent and can be analyzed independently completely I insulated from the others then the question of leading as such Doesn't Really arise but if it seems that there's a lot of synergy between the points and bye just consultation really has the knowledge to Fast Track this then I'd be more than happy to follow or lead as the case may be okay okay if I was to rephrase that question let's say in a slightly different way let's let's imagine that we're in the Inception phase of the project where we're still trying to get an idea of what the scope of the project is would you be comfortable in a setting where it is your responsibility to scope out the project and to have another analyst or another two analysts let's say that would be reporting to you where they would be more responsible for doing the details specifications when the time comes so during the Inception phase of the project typically what you're doing is you're just having them kind of tag along with you to listen to the conversations knowing that the ramping up that you're doing of these of these other analysts on your team possibly that you're going to need them to produce a lot of the details specifications with the with the knowledge that they've gained in in doing the Inception with you would you be comfortable in an environment like that are there some things that you can tell us that you think would help you carry out a role like that yes so of course I would be comfortable because I've done that before and what would help me right off the bat is to get the scooping done as quickly as possible because I realize that the school wants decided is never supposed to change but almost always changes so use your contacts diagrams use your feature list and whatever it is that you have to do I would get the scope done first and then it really fast share it with the team with the two people who are going to be speaking it out in in Greater detail and once I know once I get feedback from them how how easy how difficult it is to speak it out to flush the details out to actually get functional testable requirements and then I think I would use that feedback to refine the scope further so sometimes it is this is happened to me before where the scope as is got from a customer sort of start creeping on its own when it's detailed or okay so you'd be happy having two or three or one or two analysts tag along with you in these coping sessions to to help them along and really part of the trouble that you may run into in this situation is that you may have some analysts that who are possibly trying to get into too much detail too quickly play and we would stakeholders you often want to make sure that you're carrying out the right level of conversations with the right people and sometimes you may have to make sure that your analysts that are on your team are not kind of pulling the conversation in the wrong in the wrong direction or two level of detail too quickly as well that's good I think those are all of the questions that that I had with you I want to thank you for attending this interview and is there anything else that you would like to add before we conclude no it was great and I think it's it's fantastic for someone who wants to get into the field and has no idea about what to do so it's great and I appreciate this chance to speak to you so thank you for your time that's good and this was excellent by the way

I'm very excited to be doing this candidate Showcase with Simon wild today and this is because Simon is a very experienced professional with more than 20 years of experience in the IT industry working mostly as a business analyst a business analyst leader and everything in between Simon has extensive experience working in the public sector working in the financial services industry and in utilities so let's welcome Simon Simon welcome to the candidate showcase interview I'm wondering if we can just get started off with you telling us a little bit about yourself hi good morning now thanks thanks for doing this in Canada and the UK for 1:20 a.m. to retail stock brokers in the UK and moved from there to Professional Services freelance for a few years and move to Canada and I've been working essentially in the financial services from predominantly the fun space for the last 10 years all right excellent excellent now looking at your profile here I can see that you have an extensive amount of experience in industry and that's a professional who has that kind of experience you're inevitably going to be running into a lot of different ways of delivering software and so agile as we know is one way of delivering software waterfall is another one I'm wondering if you can speak to us a little bit about your experiences in trying to implement agile in the organizations that you've worked in sure so implementing agile I think it's really dependent on the The Experience the team that you're working with one organization I worked in agile was kind of seen as a euphemism for being a cowboy and so try to steer away from using certain terminology to try and focus more on the benefits and efficiencies and getting value out and helping people understand that so a lot of it in terms of implementing agile has been about the communication part making sure people are aware of the benefits I think that's true about implementing anything even if it's a new piece of software so different approach really trying to make sure that people are aware of with trying to keep the communication lines open making sure everyone's involved everyone's aware and what's the benefit of getting a minimal value proposition out as soon as possible what's the minimum viable product you know how can we get something out to you as value as soon as possible so that you're going to see the benefits of this straight away and then you can build on that and really kind of installing the benefits of doing that kind of minimum implementation and then building on it now I mentioned combating the The View that it's being agile can be seen as being a bit of a cowboy Behavior what I mean by that is it can have a perception that you're trying to do something just quick without any care just get something out there as quick as possible my personal View and experience is that you can put as much rigor into agile as you can in any other methodology and it's really just down to how you structure and work out what the bounds are and what the actual needs of the organization are for example if there's documentation means meets agile doesn't mean you don't document anything play common misconception I'm glad to hear you say that yes yes in a different way that's right or use a different structure for example traditional business requirement documents may have long paragraphs of text one of the things that I like to do is to break that down into finite points using a user story structure do you really make it finally something that you know is easy to understand for both the stakeholders the developers something that's quantifiable for the q18 is well and it also lends itself to to uploading into things like jira team Foundation server so you have that traceability of things as well yeah and I'm so glad to hear you say so many things that you've said because much of the perception about going agile I think in the industry maybe a little bit off of what practitioners see on the ground and how many liters many it leaders even in Industry tend to have a very overly optimistic perception of what agile can do for them or they tend to have the idea that agile is going to get them to do a lot more work in a shorter period of time I like the fact that you emphasize on the fact that the idea here is for us to get a minimum viable product out as soon as possible which is really the main purpose of going agile and I think it's to your experience is in Industry to know the fact that in many organizations agile can sometimes just be code for doing a chaotic way of doing an implementation very unorganized and so a lot of people will put the agile label on that and it's good to see that you have the awareness as an IT practitioner and as a leader you have the awareness that these are some of the major pitfalls of going agile so that's that's very great to see I see also here on your profile that you have experienced establishing a ba Center of Excellence which I think is a very large and beneficial thing that can help organizations in a big way I'm wondering if you can speak to us about some of your experiences is in taking that on sure I mean essentially I would say that one of the reasons that drove me to to do that was that the organization was working in it at the time when I joined had no understanding of what a business analysis team can do and so part of it was about building awareness of what is professionals are able to do and offer you know how can we get that to the team right and getting it out in a way that people could access it and see what was going on so part of it was about increasing the visibility of the team part of it was about increasing the capability of the team part of it was about putting in processes and procedures and I want to say putting in processes and procedures it's not a case of here's a template you must fill out section A B and C in this way it's more a case of here's a suite of tools that we have in our toolkit that could be used in different circumstances is it appropriate to use this type of uml diagram for example is it more appropriate to do a slide deck who's the audience and putting in place things like regular weekly sessions for continuous development together we would get around a table we would discuss a point or they'll be a particular learning so getting a number of different things in place to help really strengthen the capability of the team and make sure that we're constantly building that so one example would be putting together a business requirements document as I've mentioned before I like to use user stories within them say hey look here's an example could this be applied to your projects and the other part of it as well that I have mentioned is ongoing coaching so once one sessions with individual basis if they needed specific help on a specific project or a specific tool really try and help homeless skills and make sure they have a stronger set of tools in their toolkit yeah and what I really like about your approach to establishing this Center of Excellence is the fact that you're not really just applying a templated version of processes and procedures what you really encouraging your team your business analysis team to do it seems like as part of this initiative is to understand that they have a set of tools available to them but not all tools are appropriate for types of challenges and as part of being an analyst especially when you start to get into the intermediate and senior level is really having a clear understanding of what tools are appropriate for what situation so I really like the fact that you take that approach where you're making a tool set available to them and really leaving it up to the analysts and guiding them through trying to determine what tools are the right fit for what situation so that's a that's a very important point there can you maybe give us a little bit more insights around the challenges that come with having to Mentor more junior members of a team or having team members who you know a lot of times when you have different people on your team you have analysts that will have be at different levels of seniority they will be at different capability levels can you maybe just talk to us a little bit about some of the challenges of doing that type of mentorship with your team members sure I mean I would say that mentoring my Approach is more around coaching and one of the first things that can be challenges if you're working with someone as a coach they need to be coachable they need to be open to the coaching so a big challenge can be not trying to coach someone that's not willing to be coached so really understanding your team and I guess it's like with any project even you need to understand the stakeholders you need to understand the people you're dealing with understanding the communication needs really think about their needs and adapting what I do and how I approach them to their specific needs yeah and that's I think that individual style of you know trying to figure out what is a person's personality what is the working style and and working around that I think is is your approach to managing and growing and play a team of business analysts so let's switch gears a little bit and talk about some of the more practical aspects of actually delivering Solutions so product management is a role it's an up-and-coming role that has gained a lot of popularity in the last couple of years I'm wondering if you can speak to us about some of your experiences managing different products inside of organizations financial institutions or any of the other experiences that you've had sure I would say a majority of the the products work that I've done has been on regulatory products so products that sit within a regulatory framework so for example products which have taxable benefits but in order to do that so most of my experiences and then and as well as defining all of the the rules for that up front making sure that they were delivered we made sure we had the MVP of the minimum viable product launched in line for when the legislation kicked in so we're actually able to facilitate one of our clients opening the very first one of these but then looking at the backlog of other requirements so building that list and maintaining it prioritizing it so that we can get those subsequent releases out to the clients so that they have a more robust a more flexible product and then building that on keeping in constant communication with them to understand the priorities you know the other delivery Cycles we had as a software house what we had to do in terms of other regulatory deliverables what resources available against what the clients wanted so that we can get an effective release out to them so continually developing those products in a way that the client is going to see additional value coming to them regularly right right and building so the type of product you just described is a product where you basically have a set of clients that are external to your own organization that are going to be using that end product that you're building for them and as a product owner or a product manager many times that is one scenario that you can be up against but another major scenario that oftentimes gets overlooked when we discussing product management and product ownership is the organization's own internal product needs so for example you'll have an organization that needs to launch a new HR System this HR System is exclusively for their own turn on use can you talk to us maybe a little bit about the differences in the role of the product manager for external products versus internal products and some of the challenges that each of them might have I mean I would actually say that there's a lot of similarities between the two and I wouldn't tend to draw a distinction for me it's the focus on what's the priority what's the available resource what's possible for us to deliver how can we get that value out what what's really important are the regulatory milestones we have to hit is there a market opportunity we have to to hit and one organization we would regularly have a fun team identify opportunities go to launch a new fund and then we would have to adapt priorities not just for that particular product but other products that were in process live as well so that we can manage the resource can I use the product backlog managed the backlog for each of the individual products as well alright alright so it can be I think a little more complicated when you've got multiple products versus a single product but I would say that the difference between internal and external and not huge still looking at how to get the value out what's the most important priority given the resources what can we effectively deliver and I think part of the important thing that you touch on there is the fact that as a product manager you're not necessarily focusing even though you might be managing one product yourself and your organization might have multiple products there should be some recognition of the fact that your products oftentimes are not living in isolation so many times if you have some sort of a feature that needs to get released to the client in one product that can be oftentimes either constraints that you have to live by because there are other products that your product is living with or there can be some other capabilities in other products that you might be able to leverage so I think it's important as a leader what your demonstrating for us here is the fact that you understand that product management can be much more complex than oftentimes many people can think about it when they're just thinking about trying to get one single product out without really paying attention to the entire portfolio of products that in organization can have so that's a that's a very important point there now just for scenario base thinking for for ourselves I'm wondering if we can really just kind of thought talk through about how we would tackle a certain initiative so let's imagine that are senior leadership strategic at the Strategic level of organization has decided that they are going to enter a new market what the new line of business or a new product let's say we are a mutual fund company or some similar company to that and we want to get a new product a new business product out let's say a new type of fund out and we've recognized that we may need to do some extensive work inside of our organizations to build the capability to roll this new product out and to support it ongoing can you talk to me as a more senior leader about some of the things that we have to do in order to be able to roll out this larger type of initiative sure I would say that first of all the the very first thing you I will always suggest everyone does is work at exactly who the stakeholders are that needs to be involved you know what are the different teams in for a small isolated product you can do that fairly isolated within an agile team and a limited number of people who won as a larger initiative in a larger products perhaps in the processes then we need to involve more than just a small team so we need to understand who from the different teams around the organization need to be involved for example do we need the operations team do we need the accounting team do we need the sales team and who is the most appropriate person within those teams that need to be involved particularly in those discussions up front but absolutely on an ongoing basis and from a product management perspective they're going to be the the people that I'm going to be talking with the about you know what's the highest priority how do we look at the backlog what's the most important things what are the things that we need to make sure you'll be delivered and bring the compliance team in to make sure that we're hitting the regulations correctly and then look at what the needs are for each of those teams what the impact is of this new product does it mean we need to change the processes does it mean we need to change the software does it mean we need to change the manual processing and how do those pieces fit together and what's the evolution of that you know how do we look at do we need to split this into multiple phases how do we do that phase delivery and at which point do we need to bring the training in which point do we need to bring in other experts or subject matter experts in you know which point are we going to be ready to actually start working on the development of this and what's the target date for so a lot of different factors but really always focusing on what's the highest priority what's the minimum thing that we can deliver to get the value out there for this product and how do we manage the impacts of that together put in the plan together looking at the dates what's realistic what the impacts are of if we need to bring more functionality in do we need to slip the dates can we slip the dates and what are the impacts yeah and that's excellent I think that you really are focused on making sure that the internal resources are coordinated and mobilized is a very important part of making sure that that this type of a large initiative doesn't face any major obstacles because often times in organizations that try to do very large scale transformation or roll out changes of this manner oftentimes you'll find that you have the buy-in of many people in your organization but you might not necessarily have the buy-in of everybody in the organization so you mentioned compliance for example who in many organizations and many financial institutions the compliance organizations allowed at a time is stretched very thinly because of the fact that the financial industry is so well regulated that compliance really needs to be on the ball in their kind of need to be ever present in most parts of the organization and often times in those types of projects it can be very difficult to secure the time and the resources that you need to be able to to have them engaged in your project to make sure that you're okay from a compliance perspective so if you are ever in a situation where you're seeing for example that a very key stakeholder who you need for the project is really not interested in taking part are there some things that you can do to try to get those folks more engaged I think it comes back to earlier about really understanding the stakeholders and their individual needs and that sing the way that I'm interacting with them to get their buying you know how do I make that connection how do I build that trust how do I get them to understand the benefits of what yeah yes people are busy and but it's working with them to try and understand how can we actually do this together right this isn't something for me this I'm here to facilitate for you how can I make your world a better place and if let's say that is I think normally for most practitioners you always want to make sure that you're taking a software approach showing people the benefits of doing things the right way but often times if you're dealing with a group who really just doesn't have the buy-in or they don't have the resources you can still run into a dead end so do we have any tools in our tool belt is there any other approaches that we can use as a method of Last Resort if we're still not getting the resources that we want I think it's the same with any conflict and often you know I would like in Conflict to the example where maybe you have a sales team that wants to deliver something which is at odds with the regulations in the compliance team to bring those heads together and facilitating that conversation and again I think it comes back to that discussion around product management and prioritization you know as a product manager you're going to want to bring those stakeholders together and discuss the restrictions that each of those team members have you know how do we manage that what's the real priority for the organization facilitate that discussion you know I've shared change approvals where we have to really negotiate between the teams and the heads and the sea level stuff there you know what's the most important thing for the organization do we have to to take a hit in some areas in order to be able to get this greater good right and so really it seems to me like you're approach to this would be in making sure that there is a broad involvement especially on a large scale initiative like this that has maybe the buying of the CEO of the board and of all the other senior leadership to that it seems like would be to make sure that this is Bradley communicated and the leadership of the organization has the obligation really to prioritize their resources in one initiative versus another one so I think that that's typically the approach in many organizations where when you have senior leadership oftentimes you need to get access to either the senior vice president or the CEO themselves to to make sure that they are really very clear about their about their own priorities so I think that's a that's a an approach that works very well in many organizations and so in terms of the questions that I wanted to go through I think I've learned everything about your background and your profile and have a good sense for what you're capable of doing is there anything else that you would like for us to discuss well I'd like to say thank you because I think this is a great initiative and it's a great way of sharing experiences part of what's important for me is continually learning absolutely different things to pick up and I think this is a great way of making knowledge more available to the wider audience yeah absolutely absolutely and I want to thank you because I think that the perspective that many of our junior or aspiring professionals are lacking are the perspective of senior leaders who have really been on the ground in the at the implementation level so appreciate you spending the time with us to impart some of your knowledge in helping the more junior members of our community really understand how things are viewed by by the leadership of of organizations absolutely I mean I think this doesn't matter how well you're doing something there's always a better way yeah yeah and to our audience members I will be leaving contact information for Simon so please feel free to reach out to Simon and connect with them for for anything that you want and I want to thank you again Simon for appearing on the show and imparting your very valuable knowledge and will be in touch thanks and have a great day take care

in this video I have invited nitish Kumar who is inspiring data analyst basically a fresher who is looking out for a job in the power bi rule is the potential pressure and you will see in the future he will definitely secure a job in this video I will be taking his power away interview and I hope he performs very well so let's start the video and before that if you need to the channel then do subscribe it and hit the Bell icon to stay updated with all the coming useful videos you can follow me on Instagram learn with gigs where you will get regular job related updates as well it's short videos on its domain and friends do hit the like button of this video because you're one like will give me the motivation to create more videos like this now let's head towards the internet so my name is nothing I am 2023 graduate I have skills in power bi sequel Python and Excel I have worked up on several personal projects in which I have utilized these tools to solve real-world problems while working on this project I have worked upon data extraction data cleaning data modeling data analysis and data visualization part so like how many projects and in Python I have done one project on Spotify okay let's start with the first question so suppose you have three tables okay in power query and the structure of all those three tables are like similar to each other now you went ahead and upended those three tables okay but okay so you have upended now now if you want to do the clothes and apply so what will happen all those three initials plus that appendage of all those three tables will be loaded in power bi right yes but I don't want those three tables to be loaded I only want that appendix table to be loaded in power bi how will you manage this so in power query we have an option to we have option to enable road then from there we have to check that and then we will close and apply then only that particular queries do you know when when do we use have you used index column yes I am using text column what kind of scenario do we use index in my in my case my table was not having a primary key and I wanted to establish a relationship between the between two tables period and then I will check on column quality or column profile then from then from that we will be able to get a summary of our prayer column where we will be able to see how many distinct value of a column is containing and how many total values our colon is having if suppose that column contains around 20000 records OK Google yes can you tell me what is basically it's a similar to join in Sequel so suppose we want to we want to create a master table based upon based upon some other table then in that case we want to join two tables so by using a common column between both the tables we can join we can create that master table so much we have left what is left in the world from left table is not present in the right table so how do you differentiate how do you differentiate that when we see when like in general in fact table there are there are more number of data presents like there are more number of rows patients and if we see that there are some columns which are which are repeating in the table then in that case we will consider that table is a fact table but what happens in a dimensions are not represented means we will be getting the data testing Google this is and and Festival will be continuing the quantitative data and diamond WWE containing the quality of vitamins Dimension table will be having information about any particular Dimension can you explain what is a snowflake schema reduce the data redundancy okay what is cardinality cardinality means the theaters cardinality represents the relationship between two tables like how these two tables are related so this can be one to one minute to many so ideally what kind of cardinality we should prefer one too many relationships turn off slices wild in the donut chart we have the information present in the form of arts and in the Donut chat there is a hole in between and in pie chart there is no hole in between so basically the Donut chat is just a variation of a pie chart means upon requirements like what kind of visuals will be suited for our report visualization how can you differentiate a measure with a calculator and it will not be taking any extra amount of calculated what is a page level filter base level three and if you go to any other place will not be affected by this filter have you set up yes how do we how do we do that firstly Ford filter we must have a hierarchy of data like if you want to enable drill through for some great column then we must have a hierarchy of year then month and and then date and when we drag and drop that thing on our visual then that will be automatically enabled our and there is a fork like icon and if you click on that phone like I can then we will be able to do you know how to do how to set up a customer service on any particular visual for which we want to we want that to visual so we have to link that tooltip to that particular visual then if the hover over that visual then we will be able to see that in our business period I want to see the total sales of country India for example of country India should be visible okay so how do you create a measure for that I think I have to use so you are telling our power report we have to use calculate calculate function then inside the caliper function as a filter modifier we have to we have to pass the country name is India there okay now the next part is if we also have a country slicer yes so 544 how do the iterator functions work like the functions which ends with X how do you work so it basically goes Rose by Rose and then then apply the condition which we have written inside the theater function and then according to that it gets the it gives the scalar value for each group what does filter function returns a subset of our tablet tablet is there any difference between last year I do not think like I do not think there is any difference between these two phones because if so what kind of license as a developer you should have to do this we should have a license because it is it will it will be economically economically viable for that company to get to use that so if I say that nothing like I just said I can say to you that organization you have a blue license you will say yes right yes if I say to you do you have a premium license so is that right there is a difference between Pro license and premium license suppose if you ask me that you have a pro license then I will say yes but when you asked me when you say to me or do you have a premium license then in that case I will say know why because premium license is is to an organization other than any individual person so what organizations to that it's usually okay do you know about this so what can you do as a developer I can I can publish the report and I can assign a member I can assign a new user which will be having access level lower than OK Google weather in Mumbai and our awesome team which works on sale and we want that team to just see the data about cells so in that case we will be using the whole level security to show that team just the data options and enrollable security there are two types like one is a static and one is dynamic so in a static we each time we want to assign an accessible to any particular user then we have to do it but what is that we give the filter or email address to the table to the table to and then when we want to give the access then into Power service we just entered the email ID of that person then that person will be able to get the access according to his shoes okay what is a data Gateway do you remember yes so so much OK Google turn on more than 95% of the questions you said the right answer obviously from the power be a service side you don't have much exposure so we can expect that thing but other than that you have a good knowledge and you are really doing good so all the best because whatever you are doing just keep doing that and I think in the coming time you will definitely get a job as a fresher thanks for your business

good afternoon are you thank you for joining in today's interview session how are you doing today morning sir I was doing great thank you for asking so before we proceed can you give a brief introduction about yourself I graduated from economics 2019 okay so since you mentioned that you graduated in the year 2019 and since then what you have been doing so far for a couple of years I pursued civil services I gave a couple of times I cleared them last year so after that I decided to do the certification so there are so many technologies that are available right now in the market right like java.net many others so why have you chosen business intelligence to be your domain why power bi why not any other technology actually when I was doing it I wasn't much fascinated by it because I wanted I really wanted to play with you so I have always been fascinated with data so I like I like to go to the places where I can use the logical reasoning analysis and I can play with the things and I can pick up my stories I can talk to the clients and all so then it is period that I got into this was just just just something that I want you and that's why I decided to give it a shot okay so if I have to ask you to describe three things about power bi what are the three things that you would like to bring to my notice that you have learned from this tool or which has helped you to understand more about data and making sure that you create some awesome visualizations and performing on analysis so first of all the way the very first thing that is good about okay that it actually allows you to gather the data you just set it up from variety of data sources create any server or database or you can even perform a directory without actually getting in the data into the call yet so there are variety of data sources that you can pull into analyze your data the second of all it is also has an idiot where you are transformed the data it gives you very user-friendly interface that you can within a click of a few miles to and the last one I would say it's the power bi service the cloud-based system of the power yet where you can build interactive dashboards very powerful dashboards which you can share with you know multiple developers with your team also they provide you the services for streaming data the real time data they also give you the benefit of the date of course that is the power on the online basically and it is independent of the data set so that helps you differently that's great would you like to talk about the project that you might have worked with power bi yeah so I worked on a mini project with my organization okay so you mentioned that you worked under the Age of Mythology okay so can you describe me how the Sprint planning have been done in your project what was the duration of the Sprint and what all activities that you had done in the entire process can you explain it so first of all I was also have a project manager so he interacted with the client he understood the entire project whatever the business how many developers were involved in this entire project we had six tables so right so when we are working as a team there are give me a times that there are lots of opinions from different people right due to which it might lead to the rise of conflicts when you are working in a team so in case it happens with you in future that you had been working in a team and there are some conflicts of opinions that is coming into picture how you going to react to it or take this and resolve this issue if it happens first of all it is very important to understand the problems from everyone's birthday wishes should not be we should not be focused on our individual cells or individual problem we should always look it from the clients for prospective what they want and what do they expect us to do and we should do it about me that's awesome so if I have to ask you to highlight three strands who are you and you want to bring it to my notice to make this High hiring process easier what what all things you would like to highlight so first of all I like to do things very fascinated by analysis I am very fascinated that's great any weakness that you think that you might have meetings so the business I might have trouble that's great so I think I'm done with the insurance will start with the technical round if you want to have a glass of water in between you can have so if I have to ask you to rate yourself out of five in power bi how much you want to rate yourself so if I have to tell you what are the building blocks of the building alright so what type of databases have you handled using power bi so far left and then I have connected to the Super Service and some databases like so have a good time in the territory so normally how do you create or manage relationships in power bi desktop yeah so after the transformation okay so you mentioned about schema right can you describe what is a schema for in the best of my understanding what I have to schema is basically you know it's a part of a database that holds the table that holds a different tables and it comprises of it in the best of my understanding so can you tell me what is a surrogate celebrate support okay alright alright alright so talking about the dashboard that you might have created in power bi so what all different kinds of charts you have created any custom chat you might have created in any of your projects can you explain what is the Power view yeah how is it different from a power query so can you explain the difference between some function and some function yeah some function is okay so I believe you have used that you also mentioned about that so what are the benefits of using that's very using variables in deaths so variables variables actually cancel cancel can you connect to power bi like ice like I said in the beginning there is nothing to Cloud Post Office and there were ideas so so right now there are two visualizations tools that are there in the market like Tableau and power bi are you aware of table as well so why you think organizations would be using power bi more and not Tableau why you are going for power bi and not for Tableau first of all there's a case of beer and it's not that complicated and second floor you can do all of the normalization stuff all over the standardization so it basically helps us to do everything at one place we don't have to shift to other things again and again for the different ways for the different processes so that I can okay what all different views that power Be at stop container report okay and do you know about remind me to many relationships in power bi and how to handle it so yes so I can explain many to many relationships as such that you know we have different things so we have a primary key and we have so many instances of a primary key is related to the many instances of foreign a different table then that case is called a miniature helps us together okay and are you aware that how the data security what is implemented in power bi yeah so there are a few days with the data security and passwords where we can assign and we can figure out and then we can assign different uses a particularly that this department of a particular organization like financial department of security can you give an example yeah so like I said that Finance the suppose the finance department should only look at the financial field service so we can figure out we can go to the marriage in our home address in the morning so I'm outside I wish can you describe your role as a polar bear developer yes I can describe it by the project that I did in the project we had six of the developers so when the other project manager when I was talking about have you got a chance to work on data transformation what is difference between DirecTV and another important then the I want to be a he has to go all the way to the sequel server and it has to gather the data from the door so it is slightly inefficient slightly slow when you are visualized compared to when your visualizing the data from Time OK Google are different backgrounds so for that I for better representation of my results have you published a report so can you tell me what is Gateway is like a bridge what is the report services list of many different sheets and you can put in a very different visuals and we can analyze the data and that's it and then what is that dashboard dashboard is actually the collection of business services and is it possible to create all this dashboard and report from Power okay then why do we require using alphabetic stuff for using the properties I believe there are many features that you can play your data from the service what is difference between what is different between I have I have tried to use the power apps to my workplace but I wasn't so when I use the app service station do you have any questions to any one of us about so I'd be really glad I'll be ready for you if I could get a better question so that is only concerned and everything absolutely so when you will be working working in a team you will you will definitely come across people who will have similar mindsets like you with whom you your frequency will match so I believe that when you have been matches with someone at that time you jealous with that person you can share things with them and then it becomes a better environment at the workplace so it's the communication that is very important when you talk freely talk and share about your ideas without getting into the politics of the industry then I think life becomes quite easier in the organization itself and I'm very sure that if you are selected you will be working in a very healthy and that that will actually run the weakness that you were thinking that is there a new it is actually not a weakness it is basically the environment that actually affects you when you are in that zone so anyways thank you once again for joining in today's interview we'll meet very soon with the feedback session and will tell you exactly what are the areas of improvements for today's interview have a wonderful day ahead thank you bye

friends welcome back to our Channel learn with geeks in this video I have invited Hershey srivastava for the power by mock interview he is an aspiring data analyst and is working very hard on his technical skills as well as on his communication skills to get his first job as a fresher in data analytics to me so now let us proceed with the interview part and before that if you're new to the channel then do subscribe it and hit the Bell icon to stay updated all the coming useful videos and you can also follow me on Instagram and friends if you love the content then do hit the like button hello harshit how are you I'm fine thanks for asking can you briefly introduce yourself and afterwards I have given few years for government exam preparation and and after quitting government then I started learning data analytics and and has done few projects in power bi and still my learning process is going on so what is your current technical skills my skills are power bi Sequel and Excel so how many reports you have built in law in power bills so what kind of data source have you used to connect Bluetooth device and loading on a local machine and here there is a limit on data of 1 GB to be published to power bi service and Performance Bike it is better and faster than other connection mode and how's the different from DirecTV internet connection for example and if you have to open the two tables so what is the necessary condition to tables first condition is that both have same column name and the second condition is data type of each column okay and what do you mean by margin functionality in power query when when we have two or more columns and we want to we want to add it to an existing table so in that case we we use much function and we join them on the basis of a common problem and and there are different types of merchants have a column called name called for example your name is written and other names are written like complete name is now as for the requirement we want to take out the first name from that column in a separate column so how will you do that in power query we can use transform we can split the column using the Eugene like space or using Facebook and the opposite if you have to do this for example you have the first name you have the last name of a customer for example and you have to merge or combine those two to generate a caller which contains the first name and last name and how will you do that in that case we can use much column option OK Google how how are Dimension table is different from a fact table you know that all the tables are differentiated on the beaches of Dimension facts right so how Dimension Dimension contains Master data and which does not changes frequently with time and it contains it contains a primary key through which it is connected to the fact table it contains measures and the dimension key through which factor which connected to Dimension Table and there is one to many relationship from Dimension to Fat okay so you said there is a foreign key primary relationship so how do you determine that okay this column will be used as a primary key in this table and this column will be used as a foreign key in the factory so how do you differentiate like how do you determine this column I have to use for creating a relationship so first it can be it can be determined by changing it contains unique values if someone is there and it is containing unique value then it can be used as a primary key okay and how will you check that that column has unique values change by clicking on the column quality there we can check how many numbers of distinct values and unique values are there and OK Google will you do something for this relationship so that get results no I will not support this type of relationship because front of the column through which water tables are connected and afterwards we have to create a relationship between vegetable to the first table through that column and this relationship will be one too many and also we have to join this table through to the other table also through one to many relationships in the starting so what kind of schema you have practiced in now in the morning what kind of building in to multiple tables and other than that everything is image star schema like one Festival is connected to many Dimension table and the fact table is present at the center and the same overall shape looks like of a star okay so what kind of visuals you have used till now in your reports like what are all different kinds of visuals you have used in the report in the reports yes so I have scattered about yes so what do you mean by like what is the standard time and segments of category with respect different from a normal filter that we have in the filter pane of this slicer is different from a filter pin or is it or are they both the same slices and filters know they are not safe by clicking on edit interaction option which which is present in format table so so first of all I will check whether it is on edit induction option is on or off if it if it is off then I will on it and second I will check whether there is a proper relationship between the tables which are loaded in power Bi Rite so according to me when this type of problems support we want to have the total sales of country India for example yes only sales of country India so how will you create a measure for this can you write the message in the chat box yes sir I want to kill you if I'm thinking if on slices three countries and every time when I am which should give the result of total number of cells that have occurred in India forget that you have a slicer on the report just think that we have a card Visual and we have to create a measure which should give the result of total sales of India okay okay okay fine okay I should have to calculate the last month or the previous episode right yes or do you know about the okay do you know about the same period last year function yes so where is it useful it is useful when we want to get some data of previous year for the same period data from the table which is present on the one side so for facing the data we create a major enough table and then using related function the Federal Credit Union access you have total sales and on XXX you have months from January to December but when you have put months on xx's the Sorting order of the months is not in the right because the first will be January but it is starting with March okay some random some random values are there or all the 12 months are there but they're not ordered in the right way we have to order it in the right way from January to December so if this kind of situation is happening how will you resolve it first of all I will go to Table in power query editor and afterwards I will create a calculated I will create a calculator column which will be Monday and it can be done through so much and afterwards what's the message of this new calculator so how did the service not much but only I published mine report to power service so do you know about security yes I know so soft right yes so what's the difference between a pro license and a premium license as a developer as a developer which is kind of license you should have one should have license okay and how Pro license different from a premium license is a premium license a user base license know it is capacity visualizations premium license is preferred by organizations and what kind of do you know about different kind of access levels that we have service for any report do you know about admin access control computer accessories so how are you like Alexa's different from a contributor level access in Beaver beaver level access only time it is for them and user and take an only view the report and they can't do any modifications access taken they can do the modifications if required and also they can grant access to the end user or viewer and what do you mean by dataflows data flows are the Transformations done on the data in power bi service and teach transformed data can be can be loaded and it can be it can be used to report services so whenever so should we talked about roller security a few minutes ago do you know about user principal name that function yes I know so what does it do it displays the text of name of Loudoun County

say hi to Brooklyn good afternoon Google and in Excel I'm good with the pivot tables we look up its look up xlookup index match reporting on power wheel and go to the next video analyst so can you please tell me the rules and responsibility you are doing that project my Rowland responsibility as well as to date for mainly for data cleaning data services so how would you rate yourself in a scale of 10 10 being the highest I will let myself eat out of 10 we have our panel he would be going through your room so over to you something please OK Google start and I use a text from salsa to standardize text into standard is one and I use a lawyer and offer a formula mostly used to standardize text value these functions are you okay okay okay okay okay okay so can you please tell me what are the parameters one is the main substance and then we have to pass the starting point we have to specify that how many number of characters do you want to extract from the main street okay okay all right so can you please tell me the difference between a primary key and foreign key primary key and foreign key both are constant and primary key is constant which the column to have a duplicate and non values while foreign key established a relationship between tables do you know what is normalization okay so depending on their performance this ratings are given all right so I want to give let's say one people who have got one rating I want to give them 20% hike people who have got two rating I want to give them 15% hike so how do you achieve this how can I do this I can achieve this by update command and using case status where close is executed after from from command while having classes implemented after the weight loss is executed okay so can you use aggregate function Plus Los Angeles located in New Jersey license I have got some negative numbers I want to get rid of I want to get rid of the sign Okay negative sign okay so what is the numeric function you're going to use there we can use the absolute apps so what is what is the viewer temporary results so what is the use of index is a find the police please stream so tell me how do you use power bi I use a little bit more so what is the use of you what is your notice period thank you

Transcription for C:\Users\ankus\OneDrive\Desktop\AtharvAI\output_audio_files\audio_11.wav:
can you please tell me a little bit about yourself so my name is Harsh so I started my career as a production support executive for a couple of years and around 2 years there I work with Oracle and unique selling Etc and I was providing a support to the application called HP service manager then I shifted my text text to at night and then I shifted my career to cloud and I also got an opportunity to work on one side location where I started my cloud journey and in Cloud I have experience to gcp and at 0. 0 0 6 I have a team of 10 members and Technologies I'm working on ADF databricks by spark and little bit of python okay so total is around 8 to 10 years of experience here right yeah yeah 9 years okay great so shall we start with the idea of part first yeah sure okay so can you tell me how you will move the data from on Pandora in case of on Prem to Cloud migration we need to create the integration runtime manually by using a cell phone status integration run time so we need to we can download that that is kind of software we can download from is your website and we can install that into on Chromecast is not good enough and why we need cell phones to indication time is actually like it automatically decide like where the target is hosted right so because that are disconnected settings it cannot buy pass the firewall so we need to manually install the software into on sale service how cell phone you can bypass the firewall and why Auto result cannot bypass what I mean what extra you will do what is the difference there so in case of self-hosted we are manually installing the software right and after installing the software we are installing the same integration run time in Cloud side as well and there we are generating a key and that key we are mapping to on on Prince Right while installing the software on the cloud print services that that key is belongs to the cloud site that integration Center gets connected to the cloud on Samsung Cloud get connected by using that we can simply create a pipeline like we do for sale like your company and on the right hand side you have an on-prem of let's say Oracle and that is for the company too okay now I want to transfer the data from one to on Primm two using ADF how we can do that you got the question we can create a common staging location in the cloud service we can host a weekend first to connect our first company on trim service directions I want you to run a pipeline on every last working day okay of the month now how you will design that pipeline how are you so we can use it the last last day of the month let's take an easy last day of the month I think there is an option to we can take Mark to use that I like run at the last working day last day of the month that we can do that's fine that's fine now let's take it to the next level last working day not the last day now last vacation Monday to Friday and if there is a holiday at the Friday it should be like Thursday and if it is Thursday it's a holiday it should be like ovens to calendar of each month manually because it cannot be decided by the system because it depends like someone some holiday might come and like we can manually create a file and we can take a look up on that file then using the tumbling window trigger that last working day it will take from the file and as soon as that matches with that filed it will trigger to some condition we need to write yeah exactly in schedule so it's possible but I'm not sure very very much because if we want to do some customer service put some particular interval then we use the schedule window treatment and if we need to do some customization or some like you said like we need to like we need to like you skip the runs propose and and if you need to like using the same trigger if you need to run multiple of pipelines or some kind of customization if it is required then we use that I'm not getting the exact scenario in my mind something which is not a state for what they need Tumblr okay no problem okay let's talk about the few things on to the Parkside as well you can write barcode and high school sometime soon now this file is a CSV file okay now while you reading the CSV file the CSV file is we called it is not like every room is not just a number one line so I will get ended up in a multiple lines so let's say of one row of a table is like comprises of let's say five lines second row is also comprised of three lines like that so in the CSV file your one row is represented not by just one line but it's like a multi-line so every day is a multi-line rose how you doing such kind of whether it is possible at all or not possible if possible then it's a CSV file yes CSV file I think it is possible so we need to give an idea is equal to spark Dot read.csv and there is an option we need to give like multi-line is equal to 2 I think so that we can use a problem are you sure I'm not sure but I think so some options do you heard about the complex Jason value inside file if it is there then it is known as complex station make sense now imagine that you have to read a complex Json file in the spot how do you do that dot okay no worries date so let's keep this song now till this point here itself so let's get into the second part of this entire mock session that is like a feedback part so first of all I feel that you didn't exceedingly good job a few things which we can you know change a bit but whatever the monks I have taken it I think you are quite well prepared okay so let's first thing my first suggestion you know a lot of things and you need to be confident of yourself okay I can see that out of let's say I ask around 8 questions and out of that almost seven questions you have answered almost right almost right so you know a lot of things you need to be a little sound little bit more you know confident maybe it's a mock interview that's why you could be not that confident or I mean it's not that way but yeah you can be confident coming to the first question when we talked about the integration on time you were right that the cloud we need a selfish immigration on time then we talked about it why why we need it then you said it correctly that there's a firewall problem and that is there so there is a small one thing that you need to understand when I say that that how the cell phone indication on time will allow me to make a connection and why Auto Reserve will not allowed to make a connection you said it like you giving the keys here and there so that is just like the registering the cell phones to indication that is nothing to do with the connection okay so you install one machine you install the cell phone on that machine and you make a cell phone screen indication on time into your area of account and that you just registered each other there isn't the reason why is indication and time is Maya connection because the machine on which your cell phone is installed have an access to your so maybe this is coming into the same network or at least if it is not in the same network this is specific machine IP addresses fixed so this fixed IP address might have been white label or you know why did it into the fireball of that server so then if any connection coming from that machine probably will be allowed and that is why generally this is a selfish allowed to make the connection so this clarification needed okay then coming to the next stop when I when I asked like on premium you said it like put the staging layer in between there is almost right because technically understand technically it is not possible that two different system two different companies two different on-prem can be run by the same mostly it is not possible okay so because it's between whenever you're doing between the two private it's not possible the way is like you put it in the staging and then you do it because like both of them have a different because when copy activity uses it uses only one self-hosted higher so probably you need one cell phone you need one from two so that that is a problem so easy solution could be like you can put it in between the staging put that the staging data I mean staging area and then copy that so you are almost right on that there as well but be confident that's the point so that cloud to Cloud right then we talked about the last day on the last day of the month you were right there is always options you can pick that option I think that option comes for that option is going to come for the your schedule even trigger as well now the problem comes in when we say that last two working day you said it like tumbling window needed tumbling window is not necessary its tumbling window does not have any condition like that so the condition that you need to put is at your like you may be using the effectivity so if activity would be doing that conditioning so maybe you have one you said it right that you have a look up maybe in the table or in the file which is have a holiday list you pick the dates from there and you check it like okay if today's date is not I mean let's say I'm running it I would just take like tomorrow day is a working day or not if tomorrow is a working day probably and it's not the last day of the month you know it makes sense like that so you have to use some kind of an if if you follow whatever it is whatever comes along but family is not the right solution okay and then we talked about difference between the tumbling window and the schedule triggers completely wrong okay there was play don't answer so can you schedule triggers can associate with multiple pipelines but tumbling window associated with the only one pipeline but you said I mean other way around okay tell me when you can set the retries you can set the concurrency you can set the dependency with the other tumbling window all these options are there which is not there in the schedule event tickets OK Google that there is an option of multi-line and that will solve your problem of getting the multi-line CSE compilation I think if I'm not wrong at this point you don't need to have anything for the competition you just read a simple like the way you are getting it will read only the difference is when you try to access it so when you try to exit you have to you know you like dot operators so the first Jason you will see the data frame column name is a data frame dot call 111 and if that column name has another decency is a colony of that so you just only difference comes is when you access that value otherwise I think complex Jason also read in the exactly the same manner there is no other country music great so I think you did good I feel that is quite strong a little bit here and there if you try spark also looks good even though you're not spent too much time because you are a little bit on the time but I think you're doing well and you know a couple of things you have to just be confident when you answer it so be confident because when you answer it it feels like you little bit trying not very sounds confident so whatever you say be confident okay yeah that's that's it thank you so much okay great

okay so can you tell me the current project that you're working on so basically my work is related to like data scientist they create so it's basically email office is not like not detailed pipelines creation so mostly what I do is like data scientists create their own machine learning models and I deploy them I create pipelines in airflow to deploy those models into the virtual environment like staging and production okay so that's the yeah and what programming languages can you just tell me like what are the services and what was the flow like how are you social services so for sure like mostly for detail pipeline creation I have is 88 as you did a factory so I was creating Dynamic detail pipelines there and I mean including all those variable things and everything and I was utilizing like keyboard to store all this like credential parts and everything and then I should be so I still integrated and create some dynamic programming inside so what we had in the database notebook that in the customer service internet getting generated in the database notebook and then we used to published out in the month or sometime today what is the difference between data Lake and italic is basically same so but in the Delta Lake we have some added advantage of like we have Community catalog where we can add some quality checks and also like permissions to the different layer of data like we have silver layer brunch near so we can use that you look at look at that advantage of that later okay so what is the exact use of as you mentioned what is exactly like why is it needed in the first place so suppose there's any companies that like listening and not all of them are all of them need to be getting access to all layers of data so supposedly start working in the project and they don't need to get access to the old lady they just need to get access to the clean part like a cold and let's say data Engineers they need to access the role of data where all the transformation losses will be applied all the cleaning parts will be done so that's why we need to separate all these things so like Enterprise level software we need to give access properly so people can work like there will be more like data governance so have you worked on data profiling any tools or anything not exactly OK Google in the first place let's see some sample data you need it basically creates a generic script OK Google set the values of correctly properly populated for those five columns it shouldn't be like name column has some integer values so this mapping this kind of thing data profiling does so you mentioned about data governance as well could you just take me like what you how you have implemented data governance in any of your projects using in the catalog or any other tool just an idea of what you understand by data governance yeah so yeah in our project only we have to do like the auditor is to come from different sources sometimes it's coming from streaming from there we used to collect all the data into a little late or maybe less location and from there to like transform the data clean the data and put it into it has been separated you different locations in defense independent locations or something create different files are maybe sometimes in a different School database or maybe later so it's not it was not fixed for every scenario there are different requirements from the client site so based on that give me an example of One Republic Services different type of permissions so no one I mean not everyone is still able to access all this players and then he needs to go to the gold and go there will assess was given to the high level employers means that manager or maybe senior send it so yeah so that's how it was divided into the different layers and that's how it is to apply and all this information and all these things were I mean credentials were stored in keywords and keyboards access was given to from Azure this is like single thing okay so understood so what I just want to understand from you is like can you just tell me one or two or three maybe key features of the unity catalog like you said that's perfectly fine anything apart from that because just one one liners or some words would like some key features if you would say from what you have worked on what do you understand that Unity catalog exactly of course yeah one is due to governance and another is like the Storage level means that some data need not to be stored in like there are different levels of like sometimes we don't only to store the historical data for last 30 days or maybe some last one year so in row level I mean in the Bronx level live within didn't need to apply this kind of like like all data I mean sometimes it is to store it in a cold storage need it not to be accessed a very frequently but in the morning that access control as well yeah access control and like storage or sometimes what I can say like not which data was not able to access frequently was not can we also see that it offers the flow from the destination exactly how that is coming so basically it helps also in debugging right if there's any failure in between also in the pipeline you can use that for purpose as well that's good so okay just go through some of the most features to offer so some of them more okay all right so okay one more thing I want to know is two things I want to know is how much data you are dealing with and what kind of data is it what kind of files you are dealing with and what kind of data is in historical or incremental Delta load whatever so just explain that so data first of all data was no it was not limited even for now so it's not like fixed so mostly because from 1GB to 5G depends more than that and yeah and also can you please repeat history is it incremental what kind of data is it a number three is what kind of are you getting from the source and what is the file that it is being transformed into yeah sure so yeah mostly files I'm getting generated like CSV files and wish to convert the parking for me basically used to do that and yeah and what kind of data data history project we are not using such kind of things but in my old projects so you have been using Azure as well right now is this new thing in the market for sure have you had the chance to work on it not exactly mostly it was like in part of okay all right so can you tell me that what are the advantages of parking over other file formats what can first of all what kind of file format is so it is easier for when it's a problem and also it has like it is a compression technique so that's why the bike parks are more the size are very low temperature for some kind of aggregation so only we can take all this particular columns for the education do you know what predicate full stop what what exactly like what are the things why do you worked on Spotify it is temporary stored in particular station in the memories so it's very much more faster to access we can go on the data and also all this operations we are performing in the data frame it will be happening inside the memory and as like Spark so all these things will be like in the collection data shuffling stage it will be much more optimized if you're using data from okay and what about so there's a basic difference between data set and data frame can you call something you play we're not doing some pudding in the notebook so whenever I run the code after that we get home so that is run time safe today okay if you have your scholarly will see that during compilation only it will show you that it has this is a difference like compiled type safety gives you the error between during compile time only run time keeps doing that time so that's the basic difference between data and data frame as well dataframes do not give you compile time safety you will see it after you run but they said if you use if you convert into a data set you will get compiled and safety so this is a very big difference of other advantages so it depends on which one you want to use okay okay so you mentioned about lazy evaluation of can you explain that information so whenever there so those things can be like happening in white transformation so that time data needs to be shuffled in the like from 1:30 a.m. so when a white transmission is happening before that when the transmission is happening in a particular partition then all these things are like taking into the dead or in a graph all these things are not being compared so when you're collecting the data or maybe you have some white transformation and so it will wait for the college operation or maybe even so that's why it's called you okay so basically you what what is the conclusion like why is why is it so you mentioned about that do you know about lineage graph as well what is lineage graph something related to rdds yeah I mean I have to cancel OK Google what happens if what is happening in every step so basically if you added three is lost you get it from the lineage of this is what the things that were applied so that's the importance of lineage graph okay okay so you can Transformations so can you name some of the Transformations which you have used in your project and how do you use it like what was the use case and why was it needed yeah I mean there was a first level of use cases as if there was a lot of requirements to come from the customer service how can we know avoid that I mean we cannot avoid joining obviously we need to join two tables but how can we avoid I mean listen to shuffling before even joining the date of friends because I don't have a small world in them it will be a lot of traffic and I want to optimize that in this scenario I want to optimize that so what will be your approach to solve this problem first of all I need to understand why we were doing a little like after joining will be doing some operations into that pool table light that is the like that is the client has said that it's a must we will have to join so we can do like all the operations which will be happening and we can start all the parts that will be easier if you're joining the tables it will be already sorted the both parts and also so different different so maybe we are doing some applications or maybe some so we can do that part in the before joining also after doing that after something and then we can do that so that will listen to write so have you walked on police and repetition I have used can you explain like what is the difference and what it does reposition means like partitions can be increased or even decreased but call is only increase the volume decrease the volume so we are like we are like marching to partitions as a cold or something maybe we can join I mean join based on a particular criteria not join but maybe get a credit report from is created what happens after that I mean what happens after that doesn't what is the exact thing that happens after you submit this background there is like a plan gets created that how it will be executed in the background then it goes to the AQ means adaptive credit execution and it selects the most efficient method executed and that is in spark I think there's a version for it for a QE there's a version lyrics of some spiritual and above like a cube is enabled what I'm saying is that it respective of the version of spark so okay what are partitions first tell me what are partitions the condition is the partition of the data or maybe this town and yeah so that's basically partition yeah that is based on the data I'm talking in terms of spark has this partitions you can so the partitions as in like let's say 5 and those are divided into 11444 right so that is how it is created because the partitions will be created and then the data will Shuffle among the partitions know so that is the basic so that's what I'm saying so when you submit the spark of the partitions are created and then what you are saying is based on the data the data I mean across the data we will do the partitions that this will go into this partition and this will go into depart this partition so my scenario is when this partitions are created when you submit the spark shop number one how are the partitions created I mean what what is the criteria for this to be decided that how many practitioners will be created number one and number two is let's say you have to decrease the number of partitions okay so we have to options polish or republican so which one will be efficient for you are or which one would you choose to call Patricia okay so far how it is getting partition means first of all we can give the criteria the based on how it can partition if you don't give the credit then it will create like hash partition based on that will be partition the data I can see partition has maximum of 118 MB So based on how much data is there based on that little divide the partition so that I mean we can calculate the number of partitions based on that total number of data and amount of data and yeah cool is and reposition I think I'll be for reducing the data I think Coalition will be more efficient but I don't exactly remember the reason why you can't answer so have you used police station because there was a particular scenario that we have I had to calculate cumulative count for some data so some repeating data was coming and we still have a calculator that how many times did it's getting repeated before that I used to call is the data and yeah so where does school is happening because it happened in the driver many of the executor it happens to executed correct so and where does the partitions department is the most effective way let's say when your day is divided okay you don't understand 90% of the data and other partitions are empty more or less because 10% of that is just distributed so in this case there will be what there will be particular scenario what is the name of that one partition that is something more data that job will take a long time building more time as well because it has to process all that data and others are sitting empty so we have to eventually distribute the data so how can we do that we can either use School list or repetition but in this case if you see that one partition is creating more it contains more data don't you think that a full shuffling is needed because full shuffling what will it do it again full stop I mean evenly across the partitions so this is the kind of scenario when you can use repetition okay and cold is as you said like if you want to merge something is a better option yeah so yeah I mean to be exactly okay yeah so yeah more or less we are covered with spark their just go through like the you know basic concepts of it you know what happens in the back and when you run a spark job how are this partitions created in this partitions also have a relation with the number of CPU course your assigning when you run the spark job you assign some parameters as well write like number of course it will contain and how much memory you are giving so these are also I mean creating the number of particles there's a relationship with you see if you are able to access that OK Google what is the runtime for Publix what is a round tables configurations for using that what cluster you will use and there's some parameters also to be set so what is what is the date that you have used that is already assigned before projects so yeah okay so we will just cover python first okay so can you tell me the difference between deep copy and shallow coffee so run something into that objects found in the original and deep copy Concepts a new compound object and then recursively in search copies into the object on the door so what is the difference like what is the copy doing what is the exact difference in Shallow copy as you understand from the name itself right now references not the exact options OK Google okay okay have you walked on Pandora can you tell me the difference between a series and a data frame series means like as a list of talking there's a concept in Panda Express restaurant crazy run I'll write can you share your screen itself resume hey okay 97 you cannot read it two word streamers that is up to you Google can you tell me that I can check if the starting that if it begins with the same letter or not so I need to check the first percent increase will you tell me to Water Street so I need a look anyway so how can I check the first letter so I need to check for each other okay 0 0 1 okay just work on the syntax after the interview okay so you're splitting it and then taking the first index of the first word and first chocolate is in small letters so will it match when is an upper one is in small so will it return to convertible 1000 afterwards okay so just walk on the send text message to lower and then yeah 00 first letter first first word first letter second letter or second word first letter that you need to check okay just walk on the sentence that's the feedback okay okay I will quickly cover sequel as we are a bit out of time so okay I'll give you a scenario over here itself so let's say you know case statement right let's say you have kissed when to equal to bars and one equal to 9 then then three scenarios 3 van conditions what will be the output of each of them I forgot the difference so here it is not comparing the volume eight okay okay one last question is what is the difference between ranked and rank and row number and explain just with an example let's give you a data set like let's say name H salary what is the partition here Partition by name or is whatever considering partitions and ordered by everything lecture that is done just tell me that how will it assign the ranks over 4064 celery the salary it will give the angles one one okay okay so thank you for the internet 2008833 you just need to I think a little bit more yeah so right when the rank what it does is when it has died over here right it is 6060 is a time so 1:15 but it keeps the next track this will be three and this will be four it keeps number two because it is to two of them then set this problem it gives same number but it does not skip anything with the interview

welcome Raj for this interview on Azure data engineering road so can you please tell me about yourself I have completed my engineering in your 2019 from Mumbai University since then I'm having total 5 years of experience out of which my initial 2.5 years I have spent as a ETL consultant in which I was basically working with the databases and data warehousing and my recent 2.5 years of experience is in as a engineer in which I am using Azure data Factory database and have a good command over right spot and I have a background noise I have been into Sequel and this is Christmas so can you tell me about your project so my project is basically of like Insurance to me we are following basically Delta lake house architecture and here we are having like a million architecture which is on a Delta lake house so we are having a basically 3 years from Silver and Gold what we are doing is we are getting our data from multiple sources out of which one is from on Prem sequel TV which is nothing we are getting our three basic oil customer data Branch data and agent data from on premises so like that from other data we are getting in the form of directly from Upstream system in form of other because in insurance company we have to take a good understanding about weather as well so weather in formation we get from rest API once this information is better we just pulling this data with the help of ADF and loading it into our area is location and once this data is needed location then we perform different cleansing optimal activities and according to the business logic we are finally loading the data into our goal here and then from that our listing of power bi people and it can take away from there so what is the team size we are having we are seven people and others and how many pipelines you have in your project so yeah so in our project we are having 13355 minutes okay so far so it's like it's recently started project because 7 people and we have just like 30 35 lines so oh no I mean I have I have made 35 planes and in total in total there are more than 150 200 pipelines are there a big project okay so what is the most challenging situation which you face you have created a couple of pipelines so you might have encounter some of the problems so what do you feel that this is one of the most challenging situation you have been came across challenging situation yeah yeah recently we got this thing you know requirement from the client side that a certain pipeline should work only on you know only the business days like only when there are no holidays for the company so in schedule window in the schedule what we are having their we can just set like only to Monday to Friday we can set but there was this problem which we were facing if Suppose there is 15 August 15th holiday how to do that so far that was I took the initiative to myself what I did was I prepared directly or Excel file and which we put all the holidays which were there for our company from the company's calendar and just before running that pipeline we were having a basically we were having a look up activity that look up activity used to go into that file and check whether it is a holiday then we were putting a slope and if only if that particular date is not there then pipeline will run and in schedule schedule we are just putting it Monday to Friday so in this manner we have like made it possible yeah okay got it great so that's great so you said that you have and on premises Odessa system from which you are pulling the data so can you tell me what was exact that dear Source on what kind of a database it is and how exactly you pull the data from it is a SQL database Azure SQL database and we are pulling the data with the help of a copy of the music is it an on-premise is a cloud one oh oh my bad okay I was just thinking about another it was on premises okay now how you how you pull the data from Oracle on Prem to the cloud with the help of copy activity just only copy activities location in this pipeline we will use a a run time so actually there is also resolve integration run time which will not work in this case because we are pulling the data from on-prem so the data Google the data I hold it hold it you say normally Auto resolution's TV and it will provide the competition power over there from on premium and on premise and then only we can pull the data so generally why I mean the question means him why you need this helpful to indication run time why normal Auto resignation and time will not going to work when you feeling from this on-prem okay no worries no worries yourself it is coming into the landing container okay then yeah yeah yeah once the data is there in landing container with then we are again using the copy activity and we are pushing this data into the bronzer okay so you use a copy activity to push the return to the bronze layer so where is this is what kind of it is your hair is only okay bronze lyrics only now you copy the data from one Landing Zone to the translate okay then copied now then yeah once our data is there another Promise lyrics we add like flag to it so that when it when it is going to next year then we can identify this is this flag is just added to distinguish which data we have pushed further and which is a remaining so this is how the flag thing works so if my understanding is good you said that you first pull the data from your on Prem to the ADLs and that is in terms of a file or table yes yes is it yes it is a table so how you keep the table in adela's save it as a table it is it is getting saved underneath and in the form of it is a pocket file in adela's environment okay so it is a file in 88 ads in okay then what is the Brown's latest yes it is a it is a pocket file and only okay it is a pacifier but it is a table or it is a fine it is a fine just that we can access the file in the form of table because of this data lake house architecture we are using we are implementing Delta Lake up on it it is like a frame what do you say will go step by step OK Google then again you are using copy activity to move the data from your lending to the bronze layer right that is also a copy activity now where the Delta Lake comes in here you ask right so what is the format so that is why you keep it into the you copy it as a using copy activity you copying it as a file just wright Park a fighter so we are saving this file in right and this package is not operational in which we can what do DML operation and acid properties are there and we this this file will behave like a table and we can do all the commands like we used to do on the normal Warehouse normal table okay so you don't know about scenes like there is some confusion you might be talking about the databricks you started talking about the database not only the ADF because you cannot do this the email operation Etc in the the tables which are going to create like a spark tables okay okay okay okay okay okay you getting my appointment I'll come back to that in a few minutes okay so that all this get done okay now assume that all this is working fine so I assume you're using the database as well because as you said you're using for cleaning and all what size of data are getting in we are getting a play 5gb of data pipeline which is your talking about or overall you're talking about super pipeline we are getting a nearly half a GB of data per pipeline ok okay and you are doing that cleaning in the database using the spark okay how would you do this park performance optimization okay so there are an animal of using a spark performance the first way is that we can like if there are two tables on with the suppose joining is happening and we will see like if suppose any one of the table is smaller one we can go for broadcasting station so that during the joining operation essentially shuffling will be awarded because it will go and like each other table can join with a smaller table without any of so what we say data passing across what's the partition can we stopped and our time can be reduced this is one another one is we can use a broadcast joint sorry broadcast then we can use that this bucket bucket joint and this is the data is stored in form of like we can say on the lake joining is happening if on basis of country country so that whatever table which are there we will put them in Partition by Group by by country and the other table is also that and if the joining key for in case country they were also fall back in different different containers on Facebook of the country I just there is one condition that number of buckets for table one and table two should be same and then only can happen other than that there is something called as a repartition this we are doing to reduce the data skewness and apart from this there is an Adaptive which is Park internal optimization that we don't need to take care of spark on its own can optimize the query performance okay great thank you so much so I think let's get into the second half of this thank you for coming in so in the second half of this will analyze and will understand like where you did good and where you did little bit Improvement is needed okay so let's get started with this assessment so it's starting with it your presentation is good your comes is good so there you are doing perfectly well second thing is at 1:07 like we are pulling the data from data services which is one of them is ODC so it's not operational data store okay second thing I feel like you wanted to talk about the sequels are but you end up with talking as you sequel database so you cannot do Christmas Day when you saying that my source is on on Prem and then I'm pulling the data from on Prem when somebody ask you what is your on-prem TV answer is crossword clue sequel server maybe in our case you might want to say sequel server but you end up with saying that as your sequel DB which is not right because as your secrets or I just sequel server is basically Cloud one it's not a on Prem okay so keep I mean you know take care of that then your project explanation startup is good perfectly fine that is okay so that is you are ready with it then then I can probably have asked is about the challenging situation which you come up with the right only one thing which I would love would be is like you don't say how you did it until unless I asked so I asked so I want you to go on that that you said whatever was the problem you take a nap you set the stage video rightly then you leave it ideally rather than saying it like how you solve that let's wait for that question to come in okay then how you solve it so you just explain the problem and pause okay and let the interviewer ask okay then the third thing which we talked about is how you do the on-prem to the cloud right then you talked about okay we use a copy activity and then when I asked for and I ask it like only the top activity then you said about that we need to have you got a little bit fumble about about the integration run time okay so and then you talk about that we need a cell phone indication on time instead of that the auto integration and type but you are not very clear why we need the cell phone so the answer is like Auto integration on time is picking and calling it from random IP addresses so probably your private Network cannot get reached from add random IP addresses right because that is not something which is bind okay so probably that is probably your your private network will not allow to that connection to get Pastor because of your firewall and all and that's where we need a selfish indication on time so that I will be a fixed one which is connected to your database server because your database server is expecting a call from a limited IP addresses only and then yourself first and machine will get fixed and then that's IP address will be you know whitelisted by the firewall of your database server so that that connection get passed through so that is something which you need to work on you remember we have covered in our sessions okay so just go back to those questions and you know cover that the why we need the cell phone here instead of the your on Prem sorry for your auto resolve okay then we talked about your project okay then okay dad comes in and then how you going to you know how are you going to take the data forward after your lending data comes in probably at that piece ideally yes for the process maybe it's more of like either of you are copying into the bronze Lair via data breaks if you remember okay the project is not talking about is as you said as you mentioned it that it is something that you were talking about in the database side so your data is getting saved into the Browns player as a daily table but you creating those data table using the database right you create the bronze layer database and then you create your storing that translate tables as a brown Stables as a Delta table and under the hood table will get save as a parking lot you can go and do all that email operation generally normal operation is not allowed on normal spark tables but when you make a table as a Delta table then you can apply all that so then the floor is like from there once you get the data from your on-premise is there an 80s you go back to your databricks and from database you are fetching that you know tables and pushing it into using the mounting and all so I think that piece you got missed okay so just cover that up then when we talked about about this size of the data for your pipeline you said it like 5 GB initially then you get to the 0.5 GB you know so that is something which you know that's an expected question which you can always you know have a clear cut in the mind that what is the correct size okay so don't get confused between the 0.55 it was okay but why do you look very small so when you give me a very small thing you have to kiss Krystal pipeline per day something like that you getting my point so you have to Crystal Clear Define it so that eventually your number should look bigger the whole idea is that number should look bigger so rather than talking about less number try to talk about a bigger number okay and then from that you cut down to the lower number rather than take out on Lower number so you might start thinking about that one is my having a 100gb or like 100 times a pipeline in a month something like that over this is that the last week we talked about the spark optimization so for the spark optimization yeah I mean I understand you trying to talk about all those Concepts but I feel that it could be further more you know you should create a kind of a scenario and then talk about it because otherwise we will be very generous so maybe when I asked that okay you got to find it terabytes of 1 tablespoon or something like that then how you will optimize your this sparkle then you must come up with something like that okay so let's assume that on this a large database on largest generally whenever we have a small I mean when we have an arrow transformation problem does not happen so mostly this information you need to come in when we get into the kind of a white transformation so I assume that we have a lot of white transformation because of that probably this problem is coming up got it so that that's how you start up with and then you talk about it okay that will be a joint is there so now we might do a joint optimization so there could be a multiple ways in which we can do a joint optimization maybe we could do kind of repartition do using a bucket thing using something like software join or some different techniques right so that's how you slowly slowly progress it and then another good thing is that you are talking about the Delta tables okay so then there is a performance Automation in the Delta Lake of its own like you have an optimized Command right or you can run a vacuum command also which can also you know cut down some extra data which is not automatically you know delete it which is outside the retention period so all those things you keep in mind but I mean to to make your story looks more brighter if somebody is asking a very big question something like that tell me how you can optimize it so you can create a scenario around it okay so that your answer could looks more Justified okay so for example talk about the country now country is out of the scope right I mean so then you have to find your data set and then talk about the country okay so let's say for example and now let's say we are doing a joining around it so maybe we can partition the database on the country and then it will make sense to optimize it you're getting my point so that's how it's not that I mean bad but I feel like how you can make it more you know looks more better so that could be few points otherwise I will only trying too much digging into the project because a lot of people was wondering to check it like how the project think goes on so probably these points I think in the real interview maybe you not get too much dick down onto this project yeah I was purposely doing it so I hope you get you get the point like where you have to work on so yes you can connect another time after you prepare for all this and then we have a one more round of interview okay great I hope you enjoyed it and those who are watching this also enjoying and learn a lot thank you so much for coming on this see you soon love you

hi tripti hello sir good evening how are you today in biology but it will take a lot of time but in this I recognize that I can get a job at a very late period of time and the skills and the things that we are learning is really very nice and is really very interesting that's why I got interest in it sector and special in the data analysis field question about eligible for this field or not whether I can do here or not but once I started doing once I started learning things I thought that I am eligible and no such technical knowledge required in this field it is just our confidence and the and the courage to learn things that should be there inside someone tell me everything else education thank you for giving me this opportunity I have completed my schooling at kendriya vidyalaya gajapati coming to my educational qualifications I have completed my schooling that is my matriculation like Kendra video and then coming to class 11th and 12th that is my intermediate that also I have continued their at kendriya vidyalaya gajapati then I persuaded my graduation in bachelor in science biotechnology that I have done in bjb autonomous College bhubaneshwar then I did Internship for 5 minutes to interact with client and I make myself understand about the business requirements related to the data and I deal with server Excel and Tableau schedule oh nice the next one in 5 but I think you're done you know solid implementation in your project very nice to hear and also I didn't say that is also I didn't eat your project using all this stuff on Pizza Company on a pizza company extra cleaning process transformation and I analyzed many things how the sales on the particular company can be increased okay when do data collected what are the challenges you face and how to overcome the challenges while collecting data I faced many challenges like whether people did online transactions or offline transactions what they are doing how to deal with it took a lot of time lyrics the 70% work after that was nothing much more than that right on YouTube transformation like I didn't data filtration I have the weather today or duplicate values I have deleted all those things and I have transferred the that written record into some chats into tables into dashboards so that it will be easy for all to understand how the things are going on and I want to upload the data what analysis to do anything else is coming from multiple sources you extract in SQL query service online transaction is done how much email Amazon buying this how much mail customers are buying buying buying the kapisa and who are purchasing offline at what period of time the sale is high at what period of time the sale is low and I also analyze it which days of the week is the which days of the week is the more to like weekends on Saturday and Sunday people are buying more as compared to weekdays interesting how do you feel complexity like the business where do you feel that need to improve the data I don't need to improve the business in my opinions coming to myself I feel complexity through analysis and also data collection because sometimes I got confused what to do what not to do and that sometimes I get I got messed up how to do it and then I have to analyze many things I have to search more and more at that question I was little bit stuck up yes I overcome and it was interesting according to our convenience and according to a business requirements it is dependent on us how we are dealing with it what are the size of a data you did and the 10 call 8 to 10 columns this is very small amount of what is a school of work clothes there are so many operators some examples of greater than is equal to less than greater than equals to less than equal to in 19 like operator so what is you know Siri that is used to simplify simplify your query that is used what is the advantage that we have analyzed and we want to store it we can store it using view it is just for temporary use and we can create a view we can do analysis Rose from to to tables two or more tables there are four types of SQL joints they are in a joint outer joints that joint and cross joint out the joint is again divided into three types in or out in sorry right out the joint left out the joint and pull joints for experienced people what is the difference between relationship between 10 columns 3 normalization means it allows duplicate values what is the difference between diamonds and table is a table that stores diamonds and table is the tables that can be used only once like the fact table of fact table contains only quantitative value but diamonds and table does not contain 2030 value what are the type of transmission oil what is the time play Christina database schema information then we can use conditional formatting what is the maximum size 48,576 what is the difference Harry Potter there is a very minimum difference between report and dashboard because in while reporting also be represent data and in dashboard also be represent data only after analyzing the report data reporting means we are it contains data in a very windy summary way like it contains the report may contain data in written form in visualization form in graph form it can contain any form but coming to dashboard it is not attractive it is more easy to understand that you don't know how to replace a dashboard what are the steps when I collected data set I did a lot of work in data source Parts only like data cleaning almost 80% or 90% off worksheet and in Tableau worksheet I created many many graphs and also geographical graphs and after creating that I went to dashboard part and I created all those the the graphs I have created in tablet worksheet that I have put in a blue dashboard and I have sex for business requirements what is the difference between available in offline mode also but life I think it is not available offline it is only available online what is drill down in Tamil sorry that I don't remember what are the tablet product family can you be to elaborate please February reader www sorry I'm not able to do something what is your hobbies I love listening music what are you doing leaving teamwork I think I'm done with my brother do you have any questions for me anyways biologist
